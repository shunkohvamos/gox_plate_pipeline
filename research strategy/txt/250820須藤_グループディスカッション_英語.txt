Polymer-Protein Hybrids that enhance the thermal activity of proteins250820 group discussion M1 Shunya SudoResearch Objectives My research goal is to discover polymers that boost heat resistance without compromising activity for three enzymes: horseradish peroxidase, glucose oxidase, and lipase. I focus on three monomer types—zwitterionic, cationic, and hydrophobic—and apply Bayesian optimization to efficiently find the best composition ratios with minimal experiments. We start with MPC as the zwitterionic monomer, MTAC as the cationic monomer, and BMA as the hydrophobic monomer. Once we determine the optimal MPC/MTAC/BMA ratio, we will explore other hydrophobic units—EHMA, LMA, and MPTSSi—to identify the most effective hydrophobic component.Feed Ratio (mol %)Composition Ratio (mol %)PolymerMPCBMAMTACMPCBMAMTACPMBTA-18041684.42.513.1PMBTA-28016478.615.95.5PMBTA-330145630.414.255.4PMBTA-430561432.733.234.1PMBTA-55522.522.550.322.422.4Summary of this report・The particle size distribution and zeta potential of the copolymers were obtained again.・Reconsidering the research plan and rethinking material designMeasurement of particle size distributionThe data obtained using water as the solvent was not clear, so the experiment was repeated.The polymer was dissolved in an organic solvent, then dissolved and added to water.Figure 1. Particle size distribution of PMBTA (2025/7)Experimental MethodsThe polymer was dissolved in DMSO (PMBTA-1, 2, 3) and EtOH (PMBTA-4, 5) to prepare a 50 mg/mL polymer stock solution.10 μL of (1) was added to 990 μL of water.780 μL of (2) was used for measurement.1.2 Particle size distribution Particle size distribution was measured for each of PMBTA-1-5.Figure 2.

Zeta potential of PMBTA (2025/7)2.1 Zeta potentialMeasured simultaneously with the same solution as particle size distribution.Figure 4. Zeta potential of PMBTA (2025/8)In July, the measurement was performed at 3 mg/mL, but this time, in order to accurately measure the particle size distribution, the concentration was 0.5 mg/mL, which may have been too low.This is considered reasonable because PMBTA-3 and 4 have high charges due to the high content of cationic monomer MTAC.CopolymerAverage ζ (weighted mean)D₅₀ (50 %)PMBTA-1-0.161-2.57PMBTA-2-0.144-2.77PMBTA-340.946.1PMBTA-448.145.8PMBTA-514.212.4Research Plan (undecided)Considering the meaning of the three-element system.Focus on those that form complexes with polymers and proteins.Determine whether a meeting was held at DLS.Determine based on turbidity.Investigate heat resistance within that area.The interaction with proteins when hydrophobicity is changed is measured using LogP as an indicator.Focus on proteins that aggregate at high temperatures.This shows that adding the polymer we created prevents aggregation.Aim for a design that does not lose activity at high temperatures.Are there any advantages to being able to react at high temperatures?Plate reader not supported.A general indicator of heat resistance is when it returns to room temperature.Matthew J.
