                                                   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

           Experimental methods

           Materials

           All solvents and chemicals were purchased from common commercial sources (Sigma Aldrich, Merck, etc.) unless otherwise
           stated. Glucose oxidase (GOx) from Aspergillius niger, Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), Trypsin, Uricase, Lysosyme (chicken egg
           white), Casein, Manganese Peroxidase (MnP) and Carbonic Anhydrase (CAn) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, stored at -
           30 °C and used as received. Cy3-COOH and Cy5 acrylate were synthesized according to our previous report.30 Monomers for
           the polymer synthesis have been purified over inhibitor remover columns (Sigma Aldrich) prior to synthesis. The recombinant
           human TRAIL protein was purchased from Abcam (ab256115) and represents a 19.5 kDa active fragment of the full-length
           protein (amino acids 115 to 281).

           Instrumentation

           Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) measurements were performed in a DMF eluent containing 0.1 % lithium chloride at
           50 °C. Calibration was carried out using polyethylene glycol (PEG), on a Shimadzu system, equipped with an RID-10A detector
           and an Agilent PolarGel M column. 1H NMR spectra were acquired with a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer and processed using
           MestreNova. Conversion was estimated by addition of 1,3,5-triazole standard in the NMR samples. Quantification of the Cy3
           to enzyme ratio and the FRET read-out and heat assays were performed on a SpectraMax iD3 plate reader from Molecular
           Devices.

           Small angle X-ray scattering

           SAXS experiments were carried out at the Australian Synchrotron on the small-/wide-angle X-ray scattering beamline36 using
           X-rays with a wavelength, λ, of 1.033 Å (12 keV). Isotropic scattering patterns were collected on a Pilatus 2 M detector with
           an active area of 981 × 1043 pixels of 170 m2 each with a 2.3 m sample to detector distance. The magnitude of the scattering
           vector (q) is defined by q = 4π/λ sin(θ/2), where θ is the scattering angle. The samples were placed in a 96-well plate solution
           autoloader from where samples were taken automatically, and the SAXS was measured in a consistent position in a quartz
           capillary. Scatterbrain (ANSTO) was used to radially average the raw pixels in the SAXS images and subtract the background
           patterns, which were collected for each solvent mixture. Data was fit to a core shell model, using the radius and SLD of the
           protein as the core, using SASview37 and the NIST IgorPro macros.38

           Protein labelling

           Proteins were labelled with Cy3-COOH via amide coupling. The protein was dissolved in 50 mM carbonate buffer (pH 9.6).
           Stock solutions of the coupling reagents 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) hydrochloride (20 mg/mL)
           and N-hydroxy succinimide (NHS, 20 mg/mL) were prepared in 100 mM MES buffer (pH 5.5). Cy3-COOH (10 mg/mL) was
dissolved in a DMSO / water mixture. Cy3 CO2H (18.8 μL, 40 eq.), EDC hydrochloride (26.4 μL, 300 eq.) and NHS (43.8 μL,
800 eq.) were mixed in MES buffer. After 15 mins the protein (e.g. GOx, 1.25 mg, 1 eq.) was added. The coupling reaction
was left over night and purified the next day over a Sephadex G15 column in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). It was
estimated that all enzyme was recovered from the column. The amount of Cy3 in each labelled protein batch was estimated
with fluorescent reading (see table S2).

Synthesis of macro-RAFT agent




Poly(ethylene glycol) macro-RAFT agent was prepared by esterification of the carboxy functional in 3-
benzylsulfanylthiocarbonylsulfanylpropionic acid (BSPA) RAFT agent, with the hydroxy functional in 1.9 kDa poly(ethylene
glycol) methyl ether (mPEG) through EDC coupling approach. mPEG (2.00 g, 1.05 mmol) and DMAP (102.88 mg, 0.84 mmol)
were dissolved in 5 mL cold anhydrous DCM. To the mixture was added a solution of BSPA (2.29 g, 8.42 mmol) and (EDC·HCl,
2.42 g, 12.63 mmol) in 5 mL of cold anhydrous DCM. The mixture was stirred in an ice bath for 10 minutes and the reaction
was continued at room temperature for 18 hours. The solvent was condensed under reduced pressure. The product was
precipitated from cold diethyl ether twice. The crude was purified by dialysis against water and freeze-dried to afford a pale-
yellow powder. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) confirmed the success of the EDC coupling of BSPA to PEG by showing peaks at
7.29-7.32 ppm (m, 5H, ArH), 4.59 ppm (s, 2H, ArCH2), and 3.80−3.44 ppm (m, 168H, CH2−O).


Polymer Synthesis on Automated Workstation

Polymer library synthesis was facilitated with a Beckmann Coulter Automated Workstation (Biomek NXp MC). An oxygen
insensitive enz-RAFT polymerisation technique was applied for the synthesis of the polymers. As a reaction solvent, 50 mM
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 10 % DMSO content was used. Additional to the monomer mixture (0.5 M), Cy 5 acrylate
monomer (0.1 mM) was added to incorporate the relevant fluorescence dye in the polymers needed for the FRET transfer.
The initiator VA-044 and RAFT agent 2-(butylthiocarbonothioylthio)propanoic acid (BTPA) were used in a ratio of 0.1 to
achieve a degree of polymerisation (DP) of 100 units. In enz-RAFT, GOx was used to consume free oxygen in solution. For the
activity of the enzyme relevant glucose (0.05 M) and pyruvate (0.05 M) were added. GOx was added last (0.002 mM). The
enzyme was allowed to consume oxygen for 30 mins prior to putting the polymerisation batches into an oven overnight at
45 °C. The polymer libraries were used without further purification. Composition data, GPC characterisation and selected
conversions for the full library can be found in tables S4-S5. Additionally, the logP of each monomer was estimated with
https://molinspiration.com/ (table S3a). With that, the hydrophobicity of the polymer was estimated by calculating the
weighted average of all the monomer logP for each polymer. A table of the estimated log P is provided (Table S3b). The
estimated logP for polymers ranges from –163.0 to +45.5 and –24.3 to +37.6 for library 1 and library 2, respectively.

FRET assays

FRET screening was performed with Cy3 labelled enzyme at different enzyme concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1.00 μM in
low volume 384 well plates with a total volume of 40 μL. The concentration of the polymer was based on molecular
equivalents to the enzyme. Each FRET assay was duplicated. Fluorescence screens were performed at an excitation
wavelength of 485 nm and the emission wavelength was measured at 570 nm (Ex 485 / Em 570), further at Ex 485 / Em 670
and Ex 610 / 670. Fluorescence screens at Ex 485 / Em 570 and Ex 610 / 670 are the corresponding signals related to Cy3 and
Cy5, respectively. The signal gained from Ex 485 / Em 670 can be interpreted as the FRET signal, where resonance transfer
from one dye molecule (Cy3) to the other (Cy5) happens due the binding of polymer to enzyme and resulting low distance
between dye molecules. FRET ratio results with an error of > 10 % were excluded from reporting.

Stability assays

We screened the majority of the polymer libraries to investigate the influence of polymer binding on the stability of GOx
towards heat stress. For this assay, 40 μg/mL GOx in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH = 7.4) was incubated with 16 equivalents
of polymer. Per plate, two controls of GOx without polymer were prepared accordingly. This was incubated in an oven at
60 °C for 20 mins. Activity of GOx in these conditions was screened before as to be seen in Figure S4.

After the incubation period, the GOx was diluted 100-fold to 400 ng/mL. The following heat assay was automated on the
Biomek workstation. In 96 well plates, 50 μL of the dilution was incubated with 50 μL 0.1 M glucose (in 20 mM phosphate
buffer). After 5 mins, 50 μL of 0.25 mM TMB with 2 ug/mL HRP (in 50 mM citrate buffer, pH = 5.5) were added and left to
incubate for another minute. The reaction was quenched with 20 μL of 1 M H2SO4. Readout was performed on SpectraMax
iD3 plate reader at a wavelength of 450 nm.

Protein crystal structures were retrieved from The Protein Data Bank.9 Electrostatic potential and hydrophobicity were
calculated and visualised using UCSF ChimeraX program.10 (ESP) Ranging from red for negative potential
through white to blue for positive potential. (MLP) maps ranging from dark cyan (most hydrophilic) to white to dark
goldenrod (most lipophilic). No crystal structure is available for κ-casein, instead, sequence-obtained molecular modelling
shows that it consists of two separate domains: a hydrophilic domain carrying a negative charge and a hydrophobic domain
carrying a positive charge. Data obtained with permission from ref.14 Copyright 2013 Springer Science Business Media New
