of the local protein surface-polymer interactions in
stabilizing the protein structure. The shell formed
by the polymer around the HRP core in organic
solvents improves protein solubility and stability
by providing a barrier to resist both organic sol-
vent exposure and protein conformational change.
   The role of the RHPs’ composition on their
ability to encapsulate the protein in water and
toluene was investigated by using a coarse-grained
(CG) model based on the data gathered from
all-atom MD simulations and experiments (Fig.
2E and supplementary materials, section S4). A
representative snapshot of the RHP encapsulat-
ing the protein is given in Fig. 2F. The surface
coverage increases as the attraction strength
between the adsorbing monomers and protein-
attractive sites, eHh, increases (Fig. 2G) for all
solvent selectivity conditions (captured by the
attraction strength between the polymer solvo-
phobic beads, ehh). For sufficiently high ehh, there
exists an optimal value of the fraction of ad-
sorbed monomers (fA) that maximizes the sur-
face coverage (Fig. 2H). The spatial correlations
between the adsorbing monomers and the protein-
attractive sites (fig. S22A) demonstrate that the
RHPs tend to adopt energetically favored confor-
mations once in contact with the protein to com-
pensate for the entropic penalty associated with
confinement to the surface (23).
   We experimentally tested our hypothesis that
RHP is capable of interacting with proteins and
mediating their interactions with the local en-
vironment. We performed cell-free synthesis of
membrane proteins that eliminates potential
interference or assistance from the host cell
