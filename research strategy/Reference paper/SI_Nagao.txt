1. Materials and Methods
N,N-Dimethylacrylamide (DMA, 99%) was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (Tokyo, Japan).
 EosinY disodium salt (85%), cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and monosialoganglioside GM1 from
bovine brain were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). Potassium hydroxide (KOH),
ascorbic acid, and sodium ascorbate (L-Asc-Na) were purchased from Kanto Chemical (Tokyo, Japan).
 Sodium 2-(((butylthio)carbonothioyl)thio)propanoate (SBTPA),1 galactose acrylamide,2 and Neu5Ac
acrylamide2 were prepared according to previous papers. Commercial monomers including the radical
inhibitor were purified by passing through an alumina column prior to use.
   Proton nuclear resonance (1H NMR) spectra were recorded on a JEOL-ECP400 spectrometer
(JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) using D2O as a solvent. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis was
performed on a JASCO DG-980-50 degasser equipped with a JASCO PU-980 pump (JASCO Co.,
Tokyo, Japan), a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva, U.S.), a JASCO RI-2031 Plus RI
detector. The analysis was performed at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min by injecting 20 μL of a polymer
solution (3 g/L) in 100 mM NaNO3 aqueous solution (25 °C). All the samples were previously filtered
through a 0.22 μm filter.

Three types of monomers (DMA, GalAAm, and Neu5AcAAm) were polymerized using PET-RAFT
polymerization with reference to previous studies.2 Setting the monomer concentration to 0.5 M, the
monomers, RAFT agent (SBTPA), photooxidation-reduction catalyst (eosin Y), and reducing agent
(ascorbic acid) were dissolved in Milli-Q water (200 µL) at the molar ratio of 100: 1: 0.01: 1. The
mixture was put in a well of 96 well plate. The mixture was irradiated by LED lights (λ = 527 nm) at
room temperature for 3 h. The conversion rate was determined by 1H NMR, and relative molecular
weight and dispersity (Mw/Mn) were calculated by SEC analysis.

Aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide (1 M, 30 µL) was added to each well (200 μL of polymer
solution), and the mixture was incubated for 12 h at room temperature. The solution was neutralized
with 1 M HCl solution. Then, the polymer solution was added to an ultrafiltration filter (MWCO:
3000), and purification was repeated 3 times in a centrifuge (14000 × g, 15 min). The filter tip was
turned over and the sample was collected again in a centrifuge (1000 × g, 10 min) and then freeze-
dried to obtain a solid glycopolymer sample.

3. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (2.42 g, 0.02 mol), NaCl (3.23 g, 55 mmol), KCl (0.08 g, 1.1
mmol), and 200 µL of Tween 20 were dissolved in 400 mL of Milli-Q water to prepare an ELISA
washing buffer. Each well of 96-well plate (Cert.Maxisorp Nunc-Immuno plate) was washed with 300
µL of the ELISA washing buffer (5 times). GM1 solution (0.1 μg/mL in PBS) was added to each well
(100 μL) of a 96-well plate, and the plate was incubated overnight at 4°C. The GM1 solution in each
well was discarded, and then each well was washed with 10 mM PBS five times. Subsequently, 300
µL of BSA solution (1 wt%) was added to each well, and the plate was left at room temperature (25°C)
for 15 minutes. The glycopolymers were dissolved in a 1 wt% BSA solution to achieve a concentration
of 0.5 mM and a total volume of 160 μL. An equal volume of CTB solution (10 ng/mL in 1 wt% BSA
solution) was added to each glycopolymer solution to prepare a sample solution. Additionally, a
positive control was prepared by mixing 200 μL of 0.1 μg/mL GM1 solution and CTB solution (10
ng/mL in 1 wt% BSA solution). A negative control was prepared by mixing 200 μL of 1 wt% BSA
solution and CTB solution (10 ng/mL in 1 wt% BSA solution). The prepared sample solutions were
incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. The BSA blocking solutions in the wells were discarded, and 100 μL
of each sample solution, positive control solution, and negative control solution were added to three
wells (n = 3), followed by incubation at 37°C for 30 minutes. The solutions were then discarded, and
the wells were washed with washing buffer five times. Subsequently, 100 μL of primary antibody
solution, diluted 1000 times in 1 wt% BSA solution, was added to each well, followed by incubation
at 37°C for 1 hour. After discarding the primary antibody solution from the wells, the wells were
washed with washing buffer five times. Finally, 100 μL of secondary antibody solution, diluted 5000
times in 1 wt% BSA solution, was added to each well, followed by incubation at 37°C for 1 hour. The
TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (2-Component System) was mixed in a 1:1 ratio (100 v/v %)
and diluted with 10 mM PBS to prepare a 60 v/v % substrate solution. The secondary antibody in the
wells was discarded, and the wells were washed five times with washing buffer. Then, 100 μL of the
60 v/v % substrate solution was added to each well, followed by incubation at 25°C for 20 minutes.
The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μL of 1 M phosphoric acid solution to each well. Absorbance
at 450 nm was measured using a spectral scanning multimode reader (Thermo).
