Autonomous ﬂow reactors are becoming increasingly utilized in the synthesis
of organic compounds, yet the complexity of the chemical reactions and
analytical methods remains limited. The development of a modular platform
which uses rapid ﬂow NMR and FTIR measurements, combined with
chemometric modeling, is presented for eﬃcient and timely analysis of
reaction outcomes. This platform is tested with a four variable single-step
reaction (nucleophilic aromatic substitution), to determine the most eﬀective
optimization methodology. The self-optimization approach with minimal
background knowledge proves to provide the optimal reaction parameters
within the shortest operational time. The chosen approach is then applied to a
seven variable two-step optimization problem (imine formation and
cyclization), for the synthesis of the active pharmaceutical ingredient
edaravone. Despite the exponentially increased complexity of this
optimization problem, the platform achieves excellent results in a relatively
small number of iterations, leading to >95% solution yield of the intermediate
and up to 5.42 kg L−1 h−1 space-time yield for this pharmaceutically relevant
product.

automated
(closed-loop)
experimentation.[2] Continuous ﬂow pro-
cessing provides a perfect arena to test and
implement this automation, due to the
continuous nature of experiments and the
ease of automating unit operations, such
as delivering reagents via pumps.[3] Ac-
cordingly, a wide range of self-optimizing
ﬂow reactor systems has been disclosed
over the past ten years, often focusing on
synthetic organic chemistry applications,[4]
but also polymer synthesis[5] and materials
science.[6]
These
applications
highlight
the exciting prospects when the beneﬁts
of continuous ﬂow processing, such as
improved heat- and mass transfer,[7] are
combined with its enhanced automation
potential, to rapidly explore chemical space
and optimize processes.
A key aspect of automated reactor plat-
forms is connectivity and compatibility be-
tween hardware and software. This can be
accomplished in a ﬂexible and straightfor-
ward way through the use of a central
supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.[8] Us-
ing a universal communication protocol, such as open platform
communication uniﬁed architecture (OPC UA),[9] all data can
be logged and monitored, whilst the hardware can also be con-
trolled. This system bridges the gap between an experiment se-
lection/optimization algorithm and the laboratory equipment
required to operate the experiments. In turn, this enables ac-
cess to a wealth of already developed optimization algorithms,[2c]
which require only the addition of a simple functionality (e.g.,
read/write to a text ﬁle) for back-and-forth communication be-
tween the two (Figure 1). This mode of operation also provides
the possibility of cloud-based optimization. Therein, the experi-
ment selection algorithm could be based anywhere in the world,
whilst making use of the central reactor hardware setup.[10]
Arguably the most challenging detail of closed-loop optimiza-
tion is the analysis of output chemical composition using process
analytical technology (PAT),[11] which provides the correspond-
ing responses for each set of input variables. The majority of self-
optimizing reactors use gas or liquid chromatographic methods
(GC[12] or HPLC/UHPLC), providing a high level of accuracy due
to the separation of species prior to detection. However, this sepa-
ration also requires a signiﬁcant amount of time, often leading to
analysis times in the range of several minutes. Therefore, these
methods are often limited by the time required for analysis and

Figure 1. Simpliﬁed schematic depiction of the present self-optimizing
reactor platform. Input variables are delivered to the central SCADA sys-
tem in a universal format, by an experiment selection algorithm of the
operator’s choice. The SCADA system calculates the required set points
for pumps and other reactor peripherals. After the reaction takes place,
spectra are measured inline using PAT, then processed in real-time using
chemometric models to determine reactant concentrations. The concen-
trations are then further processed by the SCADA system to provide the
desired objective values, then returned to the decision algorithm for inclu-
sion to the current model and selection of the next reaction conditions.
the results will be based on only a single measurement, which
could lead to errors in the case of an inhomogeneous sample or
sample injection issues.
Conversely, spectroscopic methods have more recently come
to the fore in the ﬁeld of organic synthesis in ﬂow. These in-
struments have the capability of measuring in- or online (ana-
lyzing the whole reaction stream or in a bypass) and have sig-
niﬁcantly faster measurement times, in the range of 10–15 s
per data point. Measuring data points more frequently allows
more eﬃcient reaction operation, by automated steady-state de-
tection and time-averaged data. The combination of these tech-
niques with chemometric modeling can provide accurate quan-
tiﬁcation of component concentrations, even in cases of com-
plex mixtures with overlapping components.[13] Numerous ex-
amples of self-optimization using spectroscopic methods (e.g.,
FTIR, NMR, UV/vis) exist,[14] but their combination with chemo-
metric modeling approaches will provide a powerful real-time
evaluation method for closed-loop applications.
The current state-of-the-art applications of autonomous opti-
mization are based only on a single reaction step, with a single
analysis point. Moreover, the number of optimizable variables
(e.g., reaction temperature, concentration, reagent loadings) is
most frequently between 2 and 4. To increase the applicability
and utility of autonomous optimization in ﬂow reactors, the in-
corporation of additional complexity would be highly desirable.
Increasing the number of optimizable variables exponentially ex-
pands the accessible experimental space, but is a necessary step
to further advance the ﬁeld. The use of multi-objective optimiza-
tion algorithms also provides an opportunity to implement addi-
tional measurement points, further increasing the coverage and
applicability of experimental results.
Herein, we report the development and operation of a mod-
ular reaction platform, which can integrate multiple PAT tools
with chemometric processing. The platform is ﬂexible, allowing
straightforward communication with numerous reaction selec-
tion/optimization algorithms. To demonstrate the high level of
functionality and ﬂexibility, we carried out the multi-objective
self-optimization of a two-step process for the synthesis of the
amyloid lateral sclerosis drug edaravone, with seven optimizable
variables and three competing optimization objectives.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Reactor Concept and Setup
The present reactor setup is based on a modular microreactor sys-
tem (Ehrfeld, MMRS), incorporating thermostated (Huber, Uni-
stat 240) reactor units, as well as temperature and pressure sen-
sors. Syringe pumps (HiTec Zang, SyrDos 2) or HPLC pumps
(Knauer, Azura) were used to deliver reagent and solvent streams
to the reactor itself. All sensors, peripherals, and PAT tools were
controlled by a central SCADA system (Evon, XAMControl), via
OPC UA.[13d]
In contrast to many other reported self-optimization systems,
this platform was designed to make optimal use of frequent con-
centration measurements, provided in real-time from the spec-
troscopic PAT methods.[14] First, a ﬁnite impulse response (FIR)
ﬁlter[15] was incorporated, which was applied every time a new
measurement was received. The ﬁlter ﬁrst corrected for out-
liers, then averaged the past ten concentration measurements
in a time-weighted fashion (i.e., most recent results have the
highest weighting). This served to minimize noise in the data
stream and to ensure that the objective values were as accurate
as possible. Furthermore, there is a clear advantage versus, sin-
gle measurement-based approaches, which could be skewed by
momentary inhomogeneities or sample injection/measurement
errors.
Representative results for each set of conditions can only be
assessed once the reactor is in steady state. A common approach
to assigning steady state is to simply wait for a set number of
residence times (often 3) to pass through the reactor, yet this is
time (and material) consuming and may not always be neces-
sary. In addition to this approach, we applied a gradient-based
steady state check, using the data recorded by the PAT instru-
ments. If the (absolute) gradient between two ﬁltered concentra-
tion measurements was lower than 5 mM, the waiting time for
steady state could be reduced to 1.5 residence times. Although
a seemingly minor alteration, this check served to signiﬁcantly
reduce the time for reaction iterations in many cases—often by
10–15 min over a two-step sequence.
2.2. Single Step Self-Optimization
To examine the platform’s capabilities, a single step optimiza-
tion was ﬁrst carried out using the nucleophilic aromatic
substitution (SNAr) reaction between morpholine (1) and 3,4-
diﬂuoronitrobenzene (2) (Figure 2). Despite its simplicity, this re-
action makes up the ﬁrst step in the synthesis of linezolid, an an-
tibiotic drug on the WHO list of essential medicines.[16] This was
performed in a 4 mL tubular reactor, with four optimizable vari-
ables (and their corresponding upper and lower boundaries): 1)
concentration (0.2–0.4 M); 2) temperature (60–160 °C); 3) equiv-
alents of morpholine and triethylamine base (0.9–3.0 equiv); 4)
residence time (2.5–6 min).

tion used to test the self-optimization platform—synthesis of line-
zolid intermediate 3 by SNAr reaction of morpholine 1 with 3,4-
diﬂuoronitrobenzene 2.
After leaving the reactor and passing through the back pres-
sure regulator (BPR, set to 18 bar to prevent solvent evaporation
at high reaction temperature), the reaction mixture was analyzed
by inline NMR (Magritek, Spinsolve Ultra 43 MHz). The starting
material 2 and product 3 could be quantiﬁed using an indirect
hard model (IHM),[17] constructed using chemometrics software
(S-PACT, PEAXACT). The model was calibrated using four dif-
ferent mixture concentrations, resulting in a root mean square
error of cross validation (RMSECV) of 12.2 mM and 4.8 mM for
starting material 2 and product 3, respectively. This error repre-
sents <5% of the expected reaction concentration in almost all
cases.
A broad range of optimization algorithms for chemical sys-
tems have been investigated in previous work,[18] but the most
commonly used approaches are: simplex-based (e.g., Nelder-
Mead),[19] gradient-independent methods (e.g., SNOBFIT)[14d] or
Bayesian approaches (e.g., TSEMO).[20] The Thompson sam-
pling eﬃcient multi-objective (TSEMO) optimization algorithm,
recently introduced by Bourne, Lapkin, and coworkers,[20] op-
erates by building Gaussian process (GP) surrogate models at
each iteration, then selecting an experimental point from this
model, which is expected to provide the greatest increase in well-
described model space (known as hypervolume improvement).
The resulting set of optimal conditions is generally a trade-oﬀ
between diﬀerent objectives, so would allow an operator to tune
the reaction conditions toward whichever objective is most im-
portant at that time.[20]
In order to begin the optimization, the original algorithm cre-
ates a Latin hypercube[21] (semi-random, but well-spaced selec-
tion) of conditions, to scan the parameter space. This serves to
provide a good initial model for selection of conditions, but may
also be unnecessary for an eﬀective self-optimization experiment
(recommended ﬁve experiments per optimizable variable). Nu-
merous other types of initial data sets for self-optimization ex-
ist, such as performing an automated DoE study (e.g., two-level
full factorial design—16 experiments and one center point for
this four-variable setup).[22] Finally, it may be resource-eﬀective
to simply provide the optimization algorithm with a very mini-
mal amount of data, such as one central set of conditions.
We endeavored to determine the most eﬀective starting point
for this type of system, by running self-optimization experiments
using numerous diﬀerent start points. For this comparison, the
two objectives: 1) conversion (quantity of starting material 2 con-
sumed; %); 2) space-time yield (reaction throughput divided by
reactor volume; kg l−1 h−1) were selected. The performance of
each approach in ﬁnding optimal solutions within ≈34 iterations
is compared below (Table 1). The maximum space-time yield,
and the number of experiments taken to reach that value, are
compared, as well as the number of iterations taken to reach
>95% conversion. A graphical comparison of each of these ex-
periments is shown in Figure 3, depicting the space-time yield
achieved as a function of temperature, concentration, and resi-
dence time. Full details of each optimization experiment are avail-
able in the Supporting Information.
Although the Latin hypercube approach (Entry 1, Figure 3a)
clearly beneﬁted from the initial knowledge provided to the op-
timization algorithm, 4 and 8 additional experiments were still
required to reach the maximum space-time yield and conver-
sion, respectively. This implies that much of the initial data was
likely in areas away from the optimal reaction conditions and,
therefore, less useful to the iterative process models. It should
be noted, however, that a reduced number of Latin hypercube it-
erations may likely be incorporated without much eﬀect on the
quality of the starting self-optimization model. This is particu-
larly true for relatively simple reaction systems, such as this one,
but will require additional experiments as the optimization prob-
lem increases in complexity.
Another approach to provide a signiﬁcant amount of informa-
tion to the optimization algorithm would be the use of a full-
factorial DoE design, which maps out the results at maximum
and minimum parameter values, as well as the center of all pa-

rameters (Entry 2, Figure 3b). This approach is often used to
build reaction models with quantiﬁed variable eﬀects (as well as
variable interaction eﬀects), so it should also provide a good ba-
sis for self-optimization experiments.[22] A high space-time yield
(1.57 kg L−1 h−1), as well as >95% conversion, was reached within
the ﬁrst 17 DoE experiments (albeit in two separate iterations),
which proved to be advantageous. However, for a more complex
reaction system, it is unlikely that such solutions would lie on
the initial DoE corner points. Furthermore, when a more com-
plex system with more input variables is examined, the number
of experiments in a full factorial design increases exponentially
(2n experiments, where n = number of variables). In such cases,
a reduced factorial design (e.g., 2n−1 or 2n−2) could be applied.
To test whether this approach is still eﬀective if the DoE de-
sign space is diﬀerent from the self-optimization design space,
a second full-factorial DoE experiment was performed (Entry 3).
However, in this case, the DoE was performed in a reduced area
of the parameter space, with the hypothesis that it should still
be possible to approximate the eﬀects of each optimization vari-
able, despite not covering the exact same experimental space. As
could be expected, this approach took signiﬁcantly longer to reach
optimal conditions (29 versus 17 iterations to reach >95% con-
version), implying that there is a signiﬁcant penalty to the self-
optimization eﬃciency.
Building the initial GP model was attempted with only a single
experimental point, prior to optimization experiments (the algo-
rithm requires two data points, but in this case an identical set
point was used twice). To ensure that the optimization pathway
was reproducible, this was performed twice (Entry 4 and Entry 5,
Figure 3c and Figure 3d). Although the initial experimental set
points were somewhat divergent, the same patterns were found
within a small number of experiments. In both attempts, a simi-
lar space-time yield maximum (1.2–1.3 kg L−1 h−1) was achieved
in as little as 13 total iterations. Furthermore, the increased num-
ber of available optimization iterations actually allowed higher
maximum space-time yields of 1.43 and 1.48 kg L−1 h−1 to be
found. In addition, the total number of iterations required to
reach >95% conversion was minimal (17 and 14 versus 28 with
Latin hypercube).
Finally, an additional experiment was performed, in which a
third optimization objective, minimized E-factor,[23] was added
(Entry 6). This is simply deﬁned as the mass of waste generated
in the reaction, divided by the mass of product formed, serving to
optimize toward a process which makes optimal use of the input
materials. This was calculated continuously, based on the input
variables and the last measured product yield (see Supporting In-
formation section 5.2 for details of the calculation). Despite the
addition of this third objective, >95% conversion was reached in
only 17 iterations. Since the space-time yield and the E-factor are
often opposing objectives (i.e., space-time yield beneﬁts from in-
complete conversion and excess reagents), it took 33 iterations
to reach the optimum 1.48 kg L−1 h−1 space-time yield. Despite
the requirement for additional iterations, the optimization was
eﬀective for all three objectives, also achieving low E-factor val-
ues below 9 (including solvent usage).
In conclusion, it appears that in this case, the most eﬃcient
method of operating this algorithm is by simply starting the opti-
mization algorithm as early as possible, without expending re-
sources on pre-iterations to enhance the initial model quality.
One important consideration, though, is the amount of the de-
sign space covered by such initial data. When complex local and
global optima are present, the implementation of a design space
search prior to optimization may prevent the optimization falling
into a local optimum. The quantity of material consumed in these
experiments amounts to roughly 3.1 g h−1 of starting material 2,
which further highlights the beneﬁt of minimizing experimental
iterations.
Due to the iterative construction of GP models in this op-
timization algorithm, additional process knowledge is gained,
when compared to gradient-based and other “black box” opti-
mization methods. A qualitative measure of the parameter’s in-
ﬂuence on the optimization objective, 𝜃, is provided after each
iteration. The lower its value, the higher impact this parameter
has on the outcome.[20a] This revealed that in the SNAr reaction,
the reaction temperature had the greatest inﬂuence on both con-
version and space-time yield, followed by the equivalents of mor-
pholine. Pleasingly, all of the experiments listed in Table 1 pro-
vided similar arrays of 𝜃values, providing further conﬁdence in
this methodology (see Supporting Information for values arising
from each optimization experiment).
2.3. Multi-Step Self-Optimization
To further test the limits of the optimization platform, a tele-
scoped ﬂow process was examined. Previous applications of self-
optimizing reactors have been limited to only a single chemical
step, with one point of analysis. Due to the rapid data acqui-
sition employed here, it was thought possible to optimize two
chemical reaction steps simultaneously, taking advantage of the
multi-objective optimization possibilities to take two measuring
points into account. The number of optimizable variables in past
demonstrations has typically been 3 or 4 (5 in a small number
of cases).[10b] The complexity of the optimization problem in-
creases exponentially with the number of variables, therefore, we
attempted to push this platform to its limits with 7 optimizable
variables.
The chemistry to be optimized was the synthesis of the active
pharmaceutical ingredient edaravone, a treatment for amyloid
lateral sclerosis and for stroke recovery.[24] This can be achieved
in two reaction steps: ﬁrst a condensation of phenylhydrazine 4
with ethyl acetoacetate 5 to form the imine intermediate 6, fol-
lowed by a base-mediated cyclization (Figure 4). A recent publi-
cation detailed the need to separate the imine formation and cy-
clization reaction steps, to minimize the formation of undesired
side products.[25]
Analysis of the reaction took place after the ﬁrst and sec-
ond reaction steps, using inline NMR (Magritek, Spinsolve Ultra
43 MHz) and inline FTIR (Mettler Toledo, ReactIR 15, SiComp
ﬂow cell), respectively. The use of high temperatures for the cy-
clization necessitated elevated pressure to prevent solvent vapor-
ization. As a result, the inline NMR had to be operated using poly-
mer tubing in place of the glass ﬂow-through cell, which lowered
the resolution of the measurements. The IHM calibrated for the
three species at this point (4, 5, and 6) had higher validation er-
rors than in the previous method (15.4, 17.9, and 74.4 mM, re-
spectively), but due to the high concentrations in this step (1.0–
2.4 M), these values were deemed to be acceptable (e.g., 3.1%

error for 6 at 2.4 M concentration). The FTIR used a partial
least squares (PLS) model, which also provided suitably low er-
rors, when compared with the reaction concentrations (69.3, 36.7,
98.3, and 26.6 mM for 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively).
In this two-step sequence, seven optimizable variables were
set: 1) equivalents of phenylhydrazine 4 (0.5–1.5 equiv); 2) con-
centration in Step 1 (1.0–2.4 M); 3) residence time in Step 1 (0.5–
1.5 min); 4) temperature in Step 1 (10—50 °C); 5) temperature in
Step 2 (25—130 °C); 6) equivalents of triethylamine (0.5–3.0); 7)
additional solvent in Step 2 (0–1 × Step 1 total ﬂow rate). Three
optimization objectives were deﬁned: 1) maximize solution yield
of 6, as measured by NMR analysis; 2) maximize space-time yield
of 7, based on FTIR analysis 3) minimize overall equivalents of
reagents used (4 + triethylamine). This combination of objec-
tives, optimizing both reaction steps simultaneously, makes use
of both PAT instruments and provides a challenging optimiza-
tion problem, which will require a trade-oﬀbetween diﬀerent ob-
jectives.
The optimization experiment was initiated from the center
point of the design space (c.f. Table 1, Entries 4 and 5), which was
expected to provide the most expeditious optimization. Over the
course of ≈26 h, 85 optimization iterations were run, achieving
>95% solution yield of imine intermediate 6 and a 5.42 kg L−1 h−1
space-time yield of edaravone. Plots showing the results of each
iteration are shown in Figure 5. The solution yield of imine 6 in-
creasing with increased concentration and temperature, as well
as longer residence time (Figure 5a). The addition of a third op-
timization objective (minimizing equivalents of reagents in both
steps) served as an additional weighting, to prevent the overuse
of excess reagents. As a result, the optimization algorithm at-
tempted to reduce the equivalents of phenylhydrazine 4 (“equiv-
alents 1”), whilst also retaining high values for the other two ob-
jectives (Figure 5b).
In the second reaction step, the eﬀects of minimizing reagent
excess can be seen more clearly (Figure 5c). It appears that sub-
stoichiometric quantities of triethylamine are suﬃcient to pro-
mote the reaction, as evident by most experimental conditions
using between 0.5–1.0 equiv triethylamine. This contributes to a
total reagent excess of less than 2 in most iterations, which serves
to decrease wastage. When considering all three objectives (Fig-
ure 5d), it is clear that no single solution provides optimal values
for each. However, a distinct cluster of results exists in the top
left corner (high solution yield 1, high space-time yield, but low
overall equivalents), within which the ideal conditions can be cho-
sen. As in the previous experiment, all transient data were also
recorded (Figure 5e), showing the set points and responses for all
85 iterations.
This experiment was estimated to consume roughly 14.3 g h−1
of starting material 5, which does represent a signiﬁcant quan-
tity. Accordingly, it is envisaged that this approach to reaction to
optimization would be invoked at an appropriate state in the reac-
tion/process development timeline, where signiﬁcant quantities
of material are already available. The high material consumption
per iteration can be put down to the requirement for the reac-
tor to reach a steady state, even with the implemented steady-
state monitoring feature. Incorporation of a droplet generating
system[26] could be used to improve the applicability of this plat-
form to earlier stage of development, when materials are scarcer.
Alternatively, the material consumption could also be limited in
future developments by leveraging dynamic experimentation, to
capitalize further on the rapid analytical measurements.
3. Conclusion
We have developed a ﬂow reactor platform for autonomous self-
optimization of complex reaction systems, based on rapid spec-
troscopic measurements, processed using chemometric models.
The eﬃciency of the system was demonstrated with two case
studies. The ﬁrst reaction, an SNAr reaction with four optimiz-
able variables, was examined using multiple diﬀerent starting
points for initial model building prior to self-optimization exper-
iments. Here, it was found that beginning with a single experi-

ment in the center of the design space provided the fastest path to
optimal conditions. This knowledge was then taken on to the op-
timization of a signiﬁcantly more complex reaction system, com-
prising of two chemical steps with seven optimizable variables.
Due to this increased complexity, a larger number of iterations
(85) were allowed, to explore the design space. Within this period,
a 5.42 kg L−1 h−1 space-time yield of the API product edaravone
7 was achieved, whilst minimizing reagent excesses. This repre-
sents a marked advance in the complexity of autonomous ﬂow
reactors in both the quantity of obtained data and the size of the
optimizable design space.
