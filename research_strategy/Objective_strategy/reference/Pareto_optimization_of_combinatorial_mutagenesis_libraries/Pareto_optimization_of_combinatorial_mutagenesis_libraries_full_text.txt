Abstract
In order to increase the hit rate of discovering diverse, beneficial protein variants via high-
throughput screening, we have developed a computational method to optimize combinatorial 
mutagenesis libraries for overall enrichment in two distinct properties of interest. Given scoring 
functions for evaluating individual variants, POCoM (Pareto Optimal Combinatorial Mutagenesis) 
scores entire libraries in terms of averages over their constituent members, and designs optimal 
libraries as sets of mutations whose combinations make the best trade-offs between average scores. 
This represents the first general-purpose method to directly design combinatorial libraries for 
multiple objectives characterizing their constituent members. Despite being rigorous in mapping 
out the Pareto frontier, it is also very fast even for very large libraries (e.g., designing 30 mutation, 
billion-member libraries in only hours). We here instantiate POCoM with scores based on a 
target’s protein structure and its homologs’ sequences, enabling the design of libraries containing 
variants balancing these two important yet quite different types of information. We demonstrate 
POCoM’s generality and power in case study applications to green fluorescent protein, 
cytochrome P450, and β-lactamase. Analysis of the POCoM library designs provides insights into 
the trade-offs between structure- and sequence-based scores, as well as the impacts of 
experimental constraints on library designs. POCoM libraries incorporate mutations that have 
previously been found favorable experimentally, while diversifying the contexts in which these 
mutations are situated and maintaining overall variant quality.

1 Introduction
COMBINATORIAL mutagenesis enables facile construction and characterization of a 
targeted set of related protein variants that incorporate at each of a set of residue positions 
one of a position-specific set of amino acids (Fig. 1(a)). All combinations of the alternative 
amino acids are represented in a library, and experimental selection or screening methods are 
employed to identify variants with beneficial properties. In contrast to other methods for 
generating mutational diversity for experimental discovery, such as error-prone PCR [1] and 
site-saturation mutagenesis [2], combinatorial mutagenesis allows finer control over the 
variants being experimentally tested and thus the opportunity to better focus effort on 
variants likely to be favorable.
Computational methods have guided the development of combinatorial mutagenesis libraries 
yielding improved proteins for a variety of goals, including altered specificity, increased 
thermostability, improved spectroscopic properties, reduced immunogenicity, and improved 
catalytic activity [3]-[8]. Different metrics have been used for computationally assessing the 
quality of a library and thereby establishing a design objective. Sequence-based library 
design methods [9], [10], [11] leverage information from the evolutionary record regarding 
which mutations and combinations of mutations have been accepted. For example, our 
OCoM algorithm [9] optimizes libraries based on a one- and two-body statistical sequence 
potential derived from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the target protein [12]. 
Significantly, while OCoM evaluates a library in terms of the average sequence potential of 
its constituent variants, it is able to do that efficiently, without having to explicitly enumerate 
the variants. Structure-based library design methods [6], [13], [14], [15] evaluate biophysical 
properties of library members, e.g., assessing potential impacts of mutations on stability. 
While some structure-based methods require explicit evaluation of each library member and 
can therefore only handle small libraries [6], [16], our SOCoM method [14] and the 
independently developed SHARPEN method [15] overcome that limitation by employing a 
Cluster Expansion (CE) technique [17], [18] to convert structure-based biophysical 
evaluations into protein-specific functions of amino acid sequence alone. That essentially 
reduces structure-based library design to sequence-based library design, rendering it 
amenable to much more efficient evaluation and design of libraries in terms of average 
scores over their constituents. We leverage here these key insights from both OCoM and 
SOCoM to enable large-scale but fast library optimization.
In order to utilize the complementary valuable information provided by sequence- and 
structure-based scores, we have developed a library design method called POCoM (Pareto 
Optimal Combinatorial Mutagenesis) that integrates two objectives, optimizing designs for 
the best tradeoffs between them (Fig. 1(b)). POCoM is thus the first general-purpose design 
method to directly optimize, in “library space”, combinatorial mutagenesis libraries for 
multiple objectives characterizing the constituent variants that they will generate. While 
POCoM is generic to the scoring functions, we focus here on structure-based assessment of 
energy, ensuring overall stability of variants, combined with sequence-based assessment of 
evolutionary constraints, accounting for additional properties (maintaining functional sites, 
folding pathways, etc.). A Pareto optimal design is undominated, in that no other design is as 
good for one objective without being worse for the other objective; such designs provide the

best balance between objectives and are thus a natural set to consider for experimental 
evaluation. Pareto optimization techniques have been developed for and proved valuable in 
other protein engineering contexts [3], [15], [19]–[22], and POCoM demonstrates, for the 
first time, how to leverage this principle in library design for an arbitrary pair of sequence- 
and structure-based scoring functions. It is important to note that, as discussed above, 
POCoM is efficient in its evaluation of a library, using averages to avoid enumeration of 
individual members. Furthermore, POCoM is efficient in its optimization of designs, 
identifying all and only the Pareto optimal ones without explicitly considering all those that 
are dominated by them. By defining the Pareto frontier of undominated designs, POCoM 
provides an unbiased characterization of the two-objective design space.
We demonstrate the generality, power, and efficiency of POCoM in case study applications 
to green fluorescent protein (GFP), cytochrome P450, and β-lactamase. Libraries were 
designed for a variety of experimental contexts: allowing mutations throughout a protein or 
focused in an active site region, planning for library construction using specified mutations 
or degenerate oligonucleotides, and allowing from 10 to 20 mutation sites and 
correspondingly different library sizes. These case studies demonstrate how POCoM 
libraries incorporate mutations balancing evolutionary favorability with energetic 
favorability. The designs include a number of mutations previously experimentally 
determined to be beneficial, along with diverse new combinations manifesting different 
balances of sequence and structural scores. POCoM provides a clear characterization of 
designs to consider for experimental evaluation, along with insights into how best to target a 
study according to its particular goals and constraints.
2 Methods
Fig. 2 overviews the main steps of POCoM. Each panel in the figure corresponds to one of 
the following subsections detailing the computational steps.
2.1 Input (step a)
We denote the sequence of the target as S = {s1, s2, …, sn}, where si, represents the amino 
acid at position i and N is the total number of amino acids. Depending on usage, in addition 
to S, POCoM also requires the structure of the target and an MSA of related proteins (Fig. 
2(a)). Mutation choices to consider at each position can be prespecified, or can be computed 
directly from these inputs, as is common and we have detailed elsewhere [23], e.g., amino 
acids with sufficient frequency at that position in the MSA or suitable in the local 
environment at that position in the structure. Details are provided in the Supplementary 
Material for the case studies in this paper. Additional parameters control the design process, 
in terms of the number of sites to mutate, the maximum number of mutations at each site, 
the total library size, and whether the library will be constructed with point mutations or 
degenerate oligos.
2.2 Amino Acid Potential (step b)
POCoM optimizes libraries for two complementary scores (Fig. 2(b). It is generic to the 
details of the scoring functions being used, but we focus here on optimizing a score based on

evolutionary information (“sequence homology” score) along with one based on molecular 
modeling (“structure energy” score). We further restrict the elaboration here to pairwise-
decomposable scores (i.e., one- and two-body terms), as commonly used in practice and 
sufficient to capture the key contributions needed for library design.
We employ as the sequence homology score Φ (Fig. 2(b.1)) a straightforward model also 
used in our earlier work [9], [24] and similar to many other sequence potentials. These 
potentials have been used in a wide range of practically useful applications; e.g., we (among 
others) have engineered stable, active enzyme variants based on optimizing this potential 
[25], [26], and others have used similar potentials in additional applications such as 
predicting residue contacts [27]–[29], predicting 3D structures of proteins and protein 
complexes [30], [31], and assessing allosteric mechanisms [32]. Given an MSA, the one-
body terms ϕi(si) capture conservation for individual positions (i.e., how common amino 
acid si is at position i), while the two-body terms ϕij(si, sj) capture correlated/compensating 
mutations for pairs of positions (i.e., how common it is for a sequence to have both amino 
acid si at position i while also having sj at j). Which terms to include in the potential and 
their position and amino acid specific contributions are derived from a statistical analysis of 
the MSA, computing log-frequencies so as to yield an additive model, and keeping only 
those that are statistically significant. We note that higher-order terms are possible [24], [33], 
and the method here generalizes to incorporate them, but in practice a pairwise deomposition 
often suffices.
We derive the structure energy score Ψ (Fig. 2(b.2)) from the target protein’s structure by 
employing a Cluster Expansion (CE) technique [18] to accurately represent structural 
properties (here energy, as a surrogate for stability) as a protein-specific function of amino 
acid sequence. CE derives one-body ψi(si) and two-body ψi,j(si, sj) potentials from a large 
training set of <sequence, energy> pairs, determining which possible “clusters” (positions i 
for terms ψi and position pairs i,j for terms ψi,j) to include in the model. We employ Rosetta 
[34] to predict structures and calculate energies for a large set of randomly sampled 
sequences in the training set. Values for the potential terms are then optimized to construct a 
protein-specific model as previously described [35], enabling rapid and accurate prediction 
of the structure energy of any variant of the target based on only its sequence. The predictive 
quality of the trained potential model is assessed with a unique set of test sequences, 
typically reaching ~80% in our studies here, and previously demonstrated to be suitable for 
experimentally successful design of individual proteins [17], [18], [36] and SOCoM-based 
libraries [3].
2.3 Library Representation with Tubes (step c)
A combinatorial mutagenesis library is constructed from all combinations of specified amino 
acids (including wild-type) at specified mutation sites (Fig. 2(c)). We refer to an amino acid 
set Ti at position i as a “tube” [9], [14]. For the example in Fig. 2(c), with two amino acids 
possible at position 4 (T4 ={E4, G4}) and three at position 9 (T9 ={Q9, R9, H9}), there are 
six possible variants derived from the cross product of these two tubes: T4×T9 = {{E4,Q9}, 
{E4,R9}, {E4,H9}, {G4,Q9}, {G4,R9}, {G4,H9}}.

In library design, each position has one or more different tubes to choose from; selecting 
exactly one tube at each site specifies a library design. The tube choices at a position are 
precomputed from the combinations of allowed amino acid choices at the position (an input 
from (a)). Only tube choices including the wild-type amino acid are considered (so the wild-
type is represented in the library); a position with no additional amino acid choices is 
assigned a single tube choice containing just the wild-type. Different library construction 
contexts give rise to different possibilities for tube choices. If the library is to be constructed 
by an arbitrary set of point mutations at each position, then the tube choices include all 
possible combinations of allowed amino acids up to a user-specified size of the amino acid 
set. If, as is common to save expense, the library is to be constructed using degenerate 
oligonucleotides (i.e., a mixture of nucleotides at each of the three positions in a codon), 
then tube choices are determined from degenerate oligos that encode combinations of 
allowed amino acids. Since nucleotide mixtures in a degenerate oligo may translate to extra 
amino acids beyond those desired, tubes are filtered to those with at most a user-specified 
amount of extras. We find that in practice, due to the typically small number of allowed 
amino acids at each position, along with constraints on overall library size, the potential 
combinatorial explosion of tube choices remains under control.
2.4 Library Scoring (step d)
In order to optimize a library, we need an efficient way to evaluate its overall quality for the 
two objectives. Each variant can be assessed by the given amino acid potentials. However, a 
library includes a combinatorial set of variants, so explicit scoring of each would be 
extremely inefficient for evaluating, much less optimizing, large libraries. Instead, we take as 
our objective the average quality over the library. This allows us to “lift” scoring functions 
for individual variants to average scoring functions for combinatorial libraries, as illustrated 
in Fig. 2(d). The key is that each amino acid in a tube occurs the same number of times in 
the library. Thus the contribution from a tube at a position to the average library score can be 
precomputed as a tube-averaged score, and similarly for pairs of positions and pairs of tubes 
[9], [14], [24], [37]. Then the library average score is simply the sum of these tube and tube-
pair average scores. We note that this technique works for the objective of optimizing 
average library quality, assuming that if the average is good enough, experimental screening/
selection will identify good candidates. It remains future work to optimize libraries for other 
overall metrics (e.g., score of a top percentile).
2.5 Library Optimization (step e)
Protein library design is an NP-hard problem [38], [9]; it follows that Pareto optimal design 
is also NP-hard, with the additional practical difficulty of needing to identify just the 
undominated designs. POCoM is based on an integer linear programming technique that has 
proven effective in practice for solving the core protein design problem in a number of 
related protein engineering contexts [9], [14], [21], [39]–[41].
Let us start by considering just one of the scores, say the library-average sequence homology 
score Φ. Let xi,t, be a single-position binary variable indicating whether or not tube t is 
present at position i. Let yi,j,t,u be a pairwise binary variable derived from the corresponding 
single-position binary variables, indicating whether or not both tube t is at i and u is at j.

Then the overall library score Φ is simply the sum of these binary variables, weighted by the 
corresponding coefficients φi(t) and φi, j(t, u).
Φ = ∑
i, t
xi, t . φi(t) + ∑
i, j, t, u
yi, j, t, u . φi, j(t, u)
(1)
A similar formula gives ψ in terms of these same variables and the tube-averaged 
coefficients ψi(t) and ψi, j(t, u).
The variable values are constrained to allow exactly one tube at a position (Equation 2) and 
to enforce consistency between corresponding single and pairwise variables (Equations 3 
and 4). Furthermore, the number of mutated positions and total library size are constrained 
to user-specified ranges. Equation 5 ensures that between μ and M positions have a selected 
tube that is not just the wild-type residue, whereas Equation 6 ensures that the product of the 
number of amino acids in the selected tubes (expressed as the sum of the logs, so as to be 
linear) is between λ and Λ. An additional constraint, not shown due to lack of a simple 
expression, ensures that for each previous solution, at least one tube in the next solution is 
different.

In order to move from optimizing a single objective to mapping the Pareto frontier (all and 
only the undominated designs; see again Fig. 1), we follow a “sweep” approach inspired by 
our previous work on the design of deimmunized enzymes [3], [21], [39], [40] and protein-
protein interactions [17]. This optimization technique produces the Pareto frontier in the 
two-objective design space, without explicitly considering the dominated designs. As 
illustrated in Fig. 2(e), the algorithm starts from the homology optimal region (lower right) 
and traverses towards the energy optimal region (upper left). At each step, it optimizes only 
the sequence homology score, as described in the above integer linear program, but at each 
step it imposes successively tighter constraints to force better successively better structure

energy scores. It first identifies the optimal design for the sequence homology score. It then 
constrains the structure energy score to be better than that of the first design, and 
reoptimizes, finding a design with a somewhat worse sequence homology score (but best of 
all those with better structure energy scores, so undominated). Note that in order to 
implement a “better than” (<) constraint using the “at least as good as” (<=) constraint 
provided by the integer program solver, we use “at least as good as” epsilon better, where the 
epsilon is a small value precomputed from the library size to ensure that no solution is 
missed. The process is repeated to obtain additional designs with iteratively better structure 
energy scores but iteratively worse sequence homology scores. Thus the full Pareto frontier 
is generated, invoking the optimizer once per design.
POCoM is implemented in Python, specifying and solving the integer linear program by 
invoking CPLEX via the Python API. The source code is freely available for academic use 
by contacting the authors.
3 Results and discussion
We employed POCoM to optimize combinatorial mutagenesis libraries for three different 
proteins for different experimental contexts (point mutations vs. degenerate oligos, 
considering mutations anywhere vs. only near active sites, 10 vs. 15 vs. 20 mutational sites). 
After preprocessing and construction of scoring potentials, detailed in the supplementary 
material, POCoM was able to generate each set of Pareto optimal library designs in less than 
an hour on an off-the-shelf 2012 Macbook Pro. By way of calibration, optimizing a single 
design for just one of the objectives took under a minute; this relationship follows 
expectations because there may be hundreds of two-objective designs per Pareto curve. To 
push the limits, we also tried designing a 30-site GFP library and found that even that 
massive library design task required less than 6 hours on that same machine.
3.1 Green fluorescent protein
GFP and its derivatives provide powerful tools for biological research, with their unique 
fluorescent properties enabling researchers to track, visualize, and map subcellular structures 
and interactions [42]–[48]. The fluorescent protein field is constantly seeking additional 
proteins with different properties, and GFP is ideally suited for high-throughput 
characterization of large libraries that can produce such candidates. Here we design libraries 
for GFP from Aequorea victoria (UniProt ID GFP_AEQVI and PDB ID 1GFL), the same 
protein used in previous structure-only library studies [14], [6] seeking to modulate 
fluorescent properties by allowing mutations anywhere including the core of the protein. 
POCoM builds upon that work by complementing structural information with sequence 
homology information and thereby enabling libraries to balance these criteria. Moreover, the 
resulting GFP libraries are much larger and more diverse than those produced by other 
library design methods [6].
POCoM elucidates sequence-structure design tradeoffs—We first designed 15-
site libraries for construction by point mutation. The shape of the resulting Pareto frontier 
(Fig. 3(a)) highlights the complementarity between the sequence homology and structure 
energy scores. Plans toward the lower-right corner are optimized primarily for sequence

homology, whereas plans toward the upper-left corner are more structurally optimized. 
Moving from the lower-right incurs only a small penalty to the sequence homology score for 
a substantial improvement in structure energy, suggesting that there are many possibilities 
for variants to achieve the same degree of sequence acceptability with substantial stability 
implications. This also suggests that optimizing for the homology dimension alone could 
result in libraries with poor energies, illustrated by the distribution of enumerated variants in 
the homology score optimized library (green contours in Fig. 3(a)). Similarly, when 
optimizing a library for energy score alone, the variant distribution suggests that a significant 
portion of the library is wasted in unproductive portions according to the homology score 
(orange contours in Fig. 3(a)). But POCoM also designs libraries with more balanced 
criteria, as illustrated with the “elbow” library plan (i.e., that closest to the origin when 
scores are normalized to 0–1). Variants enumerated from the elbow plan (yellow contours in 
Fig. 3(a)) manifest a strong anti-correlation between the two objectives, suggesting that here 
the sequence record contains information complementary to energy minimization in 
producing folded and functional proteins.
Differences in plan composition reflect sequence-structure implications of 
mutational combinations—For exploration of plan details, the Pareto frontier was 
divided into seven intervals and mutation frequencies computed separately for the plans in 
each interval (Fig. 3(b)). While some mutations (e.g., S208M) contribute to plans in all 
intervals, others are more common in the sequence homology intervals (e.g., H25I) or 
structure energy intervals (e.g., N121V), and still others are predominant in intervals around 
the balanced elbow (e.g., T62A). Some positions employ different choices in different 
portions of the curve, for example, V or I at position 96. These differences in library 
composition elucidate the power of POCoM to uncover a diverse set of alternative designs 
for consideration.
A number of mutations – S30I, T62A, R80Q, V93I, L221V, and E222V – have been 
experimentally found in GFP variants, accounting for their improved or different color 
fluorescent properties [6], [49]–[53]. Strikingly (blue boxes in Fig. 3(b)), these mutations 
tend to be in designs near the balanced elbow plan, though some permeate all plans and 
others also span one side or the other of the sequence-structure trade-off.
POCoM explicates impacts of experimental constraints—We varied two input 
parameters, the number of mutational sites to employ (10, 15, or 20) and how the library is 
to be constructed (point mutations or degenerate oligos); for the sake of comparison 
purposes the tube size was limited to 2 (wild-type plus one alternative). Fig. S1 illustrates 
that, as would be expected, relaxed constraints (point mutations, larger library) yield better-
scoring libraries. Tubes in degenerate oligo libraries are constrained by the genetic code, and 
thus can’t readily pair disparate amino acid types that might have better scores. Likewise, a 
higher mutational load enables libraries to use more conservative mutations to achieve the 
same energy score. While not required by the optimization approach, we found that, 
regardless of construction method, the positions targeted in 10-mutation site libraries are a 
subset of those targeted in 15-mutation site libraries which are in turn a subset of positions 
targeted in 20-mutation site libraries. This suggests that POCoM targets more productive

sites at lower mutational loads and augments them with additional beneficial ones at higher 
mutational loads. There are differences at the level of amino acid selections, though; e.g., 
T62A occurs only in the 15- and 20-site libraries.
Potential contributions govern amino acid selections—Each mutation in a specific 
library plan on the Pareto curve can be characterized by energy and homology score 
contributions. We selected the structurally most optimized plan, with mutations S30IS, 
T49NT, R96VR, N105VN, N121NV, L125IL, N149VN, N164VN, R168VR, H169YH, 
I171GI, N185TN, T203VT, L221VL and I229GI, and compared its side-chain placements 
with those in the original structure. Fig. 4 illustrates the impact of POCoM’s optimization at 
position 169, whose side chain interacts with the chromophore core region, a location that 
can affect GFP’s spectroscopic properties. The figure also illustrates the contributions to 
homology and energy scores for each of the allowed mutations from the MSA. Homology 
scores suggest that L is highly conserved (lower scores are better) and should be favored for 
library construction. However, energetically more favorable Y is chosen over L for this plan 
because it can form a strong hydrogen bond interaction with P58 in the GFP core, which is 
also indicated by the best averaged two-body homology score. Such two-body interactions 
are reflective of coevolution, which in addition to physical proximity [28] in a structure may 
also capture indirect relationships, e.g., for allosteric propagation [54]. The example 
presented here clearly demonstrates a strong interplay between sequence homology and 
structure energy, suggesting that both potentials may be important for developing favorable 
variants.
3.2 Cytochrome P450
Cytochrome P450 enzymes play major roles in the synthesis and breakdown of molecules in 
cells. Some P450s synthesize molecules including fatty acids (including cholesterol) [55], 
vitamins, and steroid hormones, while others are involved in the breakdown of external 
(medication) and internal (cellular toxins) substances [56]. Reengineered variants of P450 
are widely used in the biotechnology industry, medicine, and bioremediation [57]. 
Constructing diverse P450 libraries can yield variants with new properties facilitating 
synthesis and breakdown of additional molecules.
We designed degenerate oligo libraries of Bacillus subtilis cytochrome P450 (UniProt ID 
CYPC_BACSU and PDB ID 2ZQJ), which catalyzes hydroxylation of long-alkyl-chain fatty 
acids. Previous library studies for this P450 have focused on sequence information [58], 
whereas POCoM integrates sequence and structure to construct diverse libraries allowing 
mutations anywhere on the protein that have the potential to modify its catalytic and 
thermostability properties.
POCoM elucidates sequence-structure design tradeoffs and impacts of 
experimental constraints—The Pareto frontier of 15-site P450 libraries (Fig. 5(a)) is 
less curved than for 15-site GFP libraries (Fig. 3(a)), suggesting a stronger sequence 
homology and structure energy relationship. The trends in variant distribution remain the 
same, however, with the homology-optimized library (green contours) tightly distributed, the

energy-optimized library (orange contours) exploring a large region of non-conserved 
mutations, and the elbow library (yellow contours) maintaining a balance of both objectives.
We constructed additional P450 libraries targeting 10 or 20 sites, and also explored the 
differences between point mutation and degenerate oligo library construction methods. As 
illustrated in Fig. S2, the curves for P450 are less sparse and more distinct than those for 
GFP (Fig. S1). The larger size of P450 provides relatively more positions for mutations, 
leading to more possible plans with slightly different scores. As observed for GFP, higher 
mutational loads can explore a larger design space and thus achieve better scores, and 
degenerate oligos are restricted by the genetic code in possible mutation combinations and 
thus obtain worse scores. Also as observed for GFP, smaller libraries select highly 
productive sites that remain in use and are augmented in larger libraries.
Differences in plan composition reflect sequence-structure implications of 
mutational combinations—Fig. 5(b) illustrates the 15-mutation Pareto optimal 
degenerate oligo plans, binned into intervals as for GFP. Out of 48 targeted positions, 43 
positions have only one alternative amino acid type and the remaining 5 having two 
alternatives. 44 mutated positions are on the surface, including 25 hydrophilic and 19 
hydrophobic. Interestingly, none of the buried residues were targeted in the homology biased 
library plans, whereas 4 core hydrophobic residues were targeted for mutation in the 
structure energy biased library plans. Considering the mutations of all plans in the elbow 
region, we see that they are enriched with mutations from homology- and energy-biased 
potentials as well as the potentials balanced on both the criteria: out of 22 targeted sites, 7 
mutations are homology-biased, 8 are energy-biased, and the remaining 7 mutations are 
balanced between the criteria. Fig. 6 further elaborates this trend, highlighting mutations 
selected for the sequence-only optimized plan vs. the structure-only optimized plan vs. the 
elbow plan. Only position 123 is shared among all three plans, while two positions are 
shared between sequence-only and elbow, and eight between structure-only and elbow, with 
the elbow plan having four unique sites. Pareto optimization thus includes many important 
mutations that would be missed by sequence-only or structure-only design, either because 
they derive from the other scoring function, or because they balance and complement both.
3.3 β-lactamase
The β-lactamase family of enzymes provide bacteria with antibiotic resistance by 
hydrolyzing the β-lactam ring of penicillin-like drugs [59]. The inexpensive screening of β-
lactamase coupled with its diversity in extended spectrum recognition [60] has allowed 
researchers to characterize functional and stability contributions of active site residues [61], 
and provided insights regarding the hydrolysis activity of β-lactam derivatives. Constructing 
diverse active site libraries can generate variants with highly modified substrate specificities 
that can elucidate structure-activity relationships and antibiotic drug resistance properties 
[62], [63].
Previous library design methods have targeted TEM-1 β-lactamase from Escheridia coli for 
sequence-only [9] and structure-only [14], [64] optimized libraries, allowing mutations in 
the active site or throughout the protein. Here, in contrast, we integrate sequence and

structure information (from UniProt BLAT_ECOLX and PDB 1BT5) [65] and explore the 
impact of targeting the active site region vs. allowing mutations anywhere.
Active site residues are more sensitive to mutations—Libraries were designed to 
target any of 32 residues within CB-CB 8Å of catalytic residues S70, K73, S130, and E166. 
Fig. 7(a) illustrates the difference between Pareto frontiers for 15-site libraries focused on 
the active site vs. considering the whole protein. With limited choices available for focused 
design, large energy and homology penalties are incurred at both ends of the Pareto frontier 
(see inset in Fig. 7(a)), also suggesting that a very small portion of the curve offers libraries 
with balanced sequence and structure objectives. In comparison to the Pareto frontier for full 
protein libraries, that for focused libraries is less curved in the elbow region, suggesting 
strong sequence-structure complementarity around the active site. Comparing their elbow 
plans, 4 mutation sites (68, 69, 165, and 236) are shared between full and focused libraries 
of which 3 have identical mutation selections (M69N, W165N, and G236A). The difference 
in mutation at site 68 is due to the existence of residue-residue interaction between positions 
68 and 71 in the focused elbow library. Overall, the focused elbow plan exhibits 8 residue-
residue mutation site interactions in comparison to just 2 in the full-protein elbow plan, 
which is freer to spread out and decouple mutations.
Mutations are highly constrained at catalytic sites—The seven representative 
regions in Fig. 7(b) illustrate mutation choices used for the variable positions in targeted 
library designs. One additional choice at catalytic sites S70 and K73, and two additional 
choices at catalytic sites SI30 and E166 were allowed for mutation. In spite of these 
additional choices, three of the catalytic sites remained unmutated across the full Pareto 
frontier. The only mutation chosen at a catalytic site, S130G, captures a mutation that has 
been experimentally verified to be functional [66]. Also, we note that focused elbow plans 
capture mutations at active site residues T71E, I127V, and I127L, which previous 
experimental studies have revealed to maintain stability and functional activity [61], [64], 
[66], [67].
Other experimental evidence—We found an experimentally validated mutation 
W165Y[68] that POCoM did not select, opting instead for W165I and W165N instead (Fig. 
7(b)). While tyrosine was considered as a choice, both isoleucine and asparagine had better 
sequence potential scores and asparagine had the best structure energy score. This analysis 
suggests that the selection of choices for library construction is a function of Pareto 
optimality and the interplay between the potentials.
4 Conclusions
We have introduced a novel method called POCoM that aims to improve the hit rate of 
discovering beneficial variants in combinatorial mutagenesis studies by enriching the 
libraries with complementary information assessing the quality of constituent variants. 
POCoM designs directly in “library space,” choosing sets of mutations whose combinations 
make the best library-averaged trade offs between two criteria. This approach enables 
POCoM to quite quickly design massive libraries expected to have good variants. By

generating the entire Pareto frontier of libraries, POCoM elucidates, in an unbiased fashion, 
the trade offs between the complementary criteria.
In case study applications to GFP, cytochrome P450, and β-lactamase, we instantiate 
POCoM to integrate sequence homology and structure energy scores and explore the trade-
offs between these scores as well as the impacts of experimental constraints. GFP and 
cytochrome P450 designs reveal that libraries constructed from point mutations achieve 
better potential scores in comparison to libraries constructed from degenerate 
oligonucleotides which are constrained by the genetic code. Subsequent analyses of specific 
designs provide insights into energy and homology contributions that lead to selection of 
specific amino acids for mutation. β-lactamase active-site focused libraries suggest that 
POCoM appropriately accounts for functional site mutation sensitivity during the design 
process by simultaneously considering evolutionary and structure energy information.
Overall, the modular nature of POCoM, its ability to quickly optimize large libraries 
enriched for complementary protein objectives, and the insights it provides into the library 
design space promise a high success rate of discovering beneficial variants in high 
throughput protein engineering experiments.

position, yielding six variants representing all combinations of these choices, (b) POCoM 
optimizes libraries to balance two objectives, here sequence homology and structure energy, 
each to be minimized. It evaluates a library in terms of the average score of its variants.

POCoM overview, (a) Input data are collected and preprocessed, (b) Amino acid potentials 
are extracted from the target’s sequence and structure, (c) Possible sets of amino acids are 
determined at each position, thereby defining choices representing a library, (d) Scores for 
each position-specific amino acid set, or “tube”, are averaged in order to assign contributions 
to the sequence homology (Φ) and structure energy (Ψ) library scores, (e) Pareto optimal 
libraries are optimized with a sweeping technique that repeatedly finds the next undominated 
design as that with the best Φ while constrained to have reduced Ψ.
