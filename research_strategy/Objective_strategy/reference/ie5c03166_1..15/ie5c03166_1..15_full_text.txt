ABSTRACT: Designing molecules that must satisfy multiple,
often conflicting, objectives is a central challenge in molecular
discovery. The enormous size of the chemical space and the cost of
high-fidelity simulations have driven the development of machine
learning-guided strategies for accelerating design with limited data.
Among these, Bayesian optimization (BO) offers a principled
framework for sample-efficient search, while generative models
provide a mechanism to propose novel, diverse candidates beyond
fixed libraries. However, existing methods that couple the two
often rely on continuous latent spaces, which introduce both
architectural entanglement and scalability challenges. This work introduces an alternative, modular “generate-then-optimize”
framework for de novo multiobjective molecular design/discovery. At each iteration, a generative model is used to construct a large,
diverse pool of candidate molecules, after which a novel acquisition function, qPMHI (multipoint Probability of Maximum
Hypervolume Improvement), is used to optimally select a batch of candidates most likely to induce the largest Pareto front
expansion. The key insight is that qPMHI decomposes additively, enabling exact, scalable batch selection via only a simple ranking of
probabilities that can be easily estimated with Monte Carlo sampling. We benchmark the framework against state-of-the-art latent-
space and discrete molecular optimization methods, demonstrating significant improvements across synthetic benchmarks and
application-driven tasks. Specifically, in a case study related to sustainable energy storage, we show that our approach quickly
uncovers novel, diverse, and high-performing organic (quinone-based) cathode materials for aqueous redox flow battery applications.
1. INTRODUCTION
Designing molecules that satisfy multiple competing criteria
remains a grand challenge at the interface of chemistry, materials
science, and artificial intelligence (AI). While high-throughput
virtual screening has enabled significant advances in areas such
as drug discovery,1−3 catalysis,4,5 and materials engineering,6−8
its brute-force nature is not well-suited to the vastness of
chemical space, which is estimated to exceed 1060 synthetically
accessible compounds.9 In recent years, AI-guided strategies
that combine predictive modeling with intelligent search have
emerged as promising alternatives, offering dramatic improve-
ments in sample efficiency and enabling discovery beyond the
limitations of enumerated libraries.10−13
In real-world molecular design settings, the optimization of a
single property in isolation is rarely sufficient. Instead, designers
must navigate trade-offs among conflicting objectives. For
example, organic electrode materials (OEMs) must simulta-
neously exhibit high redox potential for battery voltage and low
solubility (in the electrolyte) to ensure cycle stability.14,15 Drug
candidates must balance potency against adsorption, distribu-
tion, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) constraints.16
Catalysts, in turn, must weigh activity against selectivity toward
the desired products.17,18 The molecular discovery literature
includes a wide variety of approaches for tackling the so-called
“inverse problem”19−21 of mapping properties to structure.
Although many studies describe themselves as “multiobjective,”
the distinction from single-objective or constrained optimiza-
tion is often muddied. As noted in a recent review,22 it is
common to use scalarization methods that collapse objectives
into a single composite score (e.g., a weighted sum of
objectives23−26), yielding only one solution per run. Rigorous
multiobjective optimization (MOO),27,28 on the other hand,
aims to identify the full Pareto front (i.e., the set of
nondominated solutions that collectively reveal the balance of

trade-offs among objectives), thus enabling more informed
downstream decision-making.
Bayesian optimization (BO)29−31 has become a widely used
framework for sample-efficient MOO, particularly when each
evaluation is costly. In the conventional library-based workflow,
a finite set of candidate molecules is assembled by using
combinatorial enumeration, retrosynthesis reconstruction, or
scaffold-based heuristics. A surrogate model, such as a Gaussian
process (GP)32−34 or Bayesian neural network (BNN),35,36 is
trained on a modest number of labeled examples. Acquisition
functions that balance predicted performance and uncertainty
(such as expected hypervolume improvement) are then used to
iteratively select new candidates for evaluation.37 This approach
has been successfully applied to optimize the properties of
organic molecules,38 transition-metal complexes,39 and metal−
organic frameworks.40 However, it is inherently constrained by
the need for either a fixed, fully enumerable candidate set or a
continuous design spaceconditions that rarely hold in de novo
molecular discovery.22
To overcome these limitations, recent work has explored
integrating generative models with BO. Generative methods,
which have proven highly effective in domains such as image and
language modeling,41,42 can be adapted to propose novel
chemical structures automatically. A common approach is to
train a variational autoencoder (VAE)43 to map discrete
molecular representations (such as SMILES strings44 or
molecular graphs45) into a continuous latent space, conduct
BO in this space, and then decode the resulting latent vectors
back into molecular structures. While theoretically appealing,
this “latent-optimize-then-decode” paradigm presents several
practical challenges. Decoder outputs are often invalid or highly
redundant.46 Latent spaces can remain high-dimensional and
poorly structured, which complicates surrogate modeling and
uncertainty quantification (UQ).47 Batch acquisition, which is
crucial for leveraging parallel evaluations, is typically handled
using heuristics (such as the Kriging believer48 or local
penalization49) that have known limitations.50 Finally, the
need to jointly train the encoder, decoder, and property
predictor creates a high degree of architectural coupling, making
the overall model fragile and difficult to train/tune.
This work introduces a complementary methodology that
reverses this paradigm: generate first and then optimize second.
As illustrated in Figure 1, any generative model, such as a VAE,43
diffusion model,51 genetic algorithm (GA),52 or reinforcement
learning (RL) policy,53 is first used to “dream” a large and
diverse pool of molecular candidates. This generation step can
incorporate user-specified preferences (e.g., prioritizing under-
explored regions or skewed property targets) and does not
require novelty/diversity filtering. At this stage, the goal is to
propose as many plausibly useful candidates as possible. In the
second stage, a new acquisition function, referred to as qPMHI
(multipoint Probability of Maximum Hypervolume Improve-
ment), is used to select a batch of molecules that are most likely
to induce the largest expansion of the Pareto front once queried.
Because qPMHI decomposes additively across candidates, it can
be optimized by selecting the top candidates ranked by a scalar
acquisition score, extending ideas from the recently proposed
qPO method.54 This additive structure allows for efficient batch
selection from large candidate pools without requiring any
combinatorial optimization. Our two-stage view is similar in
Figure 1. Overview of the proposed two-stage de novo multiobjective molecular optimization framework. In Stage 1, a generative approach proposes a
large pool of candidate molecules, which may be represented in diverse formats (e.g., graphs, SMILES, and fingerprints). These candidates can be
tailored to reflect user-defined biases toward specific regions of chemical space, high predicted property values, or high epistemic uncertainty. In Stage
2, a probabilistic surrogate model (trained on labeled molecules) is used to predict objective values and uncertainty. Monte Carlo posterior sampling is
used to estimate the probability that each candidate achieves maximum hypervolume improvement (HVI), yielding a simple acquisition function,
qPMHI, that decomposes additively across candidates. Thus, the optimal batch can be easily selected by sorting the candidates by their maximum HVI
score.

spirit to recent work that links a policy-gradient generator with
an active learning loop to oversample each epoch and then select
a subset for expensive oracle calls.55 In contrast, we make this
separation explicit, and generator-agnostic: Stage 1 can be any
generator (or combination thereof), while Stage 2 performs a
new and specific type of batch acquisition that supports single
objective and multiobjective problems as well as small to large
batches.
A key strength of our proposed “generate-then-optimize”
framework lies in its modularity. In particular, the generative
model and surrogate property model can be fully decoupled,
allowing for any combination of architectures or molecular
representations at each stage. For example, generative decoders
that are prone to producing invalid structures can be paired with
encoder-only graph neural networks (GNNs) for property
prediction.56 This decoupling also enables flexible UQ, ranging
from exact GPs to deep ensembles and BNNs. By reducing
architectural entanglement, the framework facilitates more
robust training and easier tuning compared with the
aforementioned latent-space approaches.
We validated the proposed framework through two
complementary case studies. The first benchmark performance
on a widely used dataset of drug-like molecules, enabling direct
comparison to several existing generative optimization methods
in both single- and multiobjective settings. The second case
study targets a practically relevant molecular design problem in
energy storage: the discovery of quinone-based OEMs for
aqueous redox flow battery (RFB) applications. Here, we aim to
jointly maximize the redox potential (to increase cell voltage)
and minimize the aqueous solubility (to enhance useful cycle
life). In both settings, our method consistently identifies high-
performing candidates that expand the Pareto front with fewer
queries than baseline approaches, highlighting its broad
applicability and potential effectiveness for accelerating
discovery in chemically realistic design spaces.
2. RELATED WORK
Property-driven molecular design seeks to discover chemical
structures that satisfy one or more desired properties, without
relying on brute-force enumeration of all possibilities. Existing
strategies generally fall into two categories: selection-based
methods, which search over a fixed library of candidate
molecules, and generation-based methods, which construct
novel molecules during the search process, potentially
producing structures that have not been synthesized or even
considered before. Across both categories, BO has become a
leading framework for efficient discovery when each evaluation
is expensive. However, the integration of BO with discrete
chemical representations varies substantially depending on the
design space and the modeling strategy. Below, we summarize
some of the main contributions across these different
approaches.
2.1. Library-Based Multiobjective BO for Molecular
Design. Some of the earliest successes in multiobjective BO for
molecular design relied on large, preconstructed libraries. These
libraries were often generated using domain heuristics or
combinatorial enumeration. Janet et al.39 optimized redox
potential and aqueous solubility over a library of 2.8 million
transition-metal complexes using a neural network surrogate
model with latent-distance UQ and greedy expected Hyper-
volume improvement. Their approach achieved nearly 500-fold
greater sample efficiency compared with a naive random search
strategy. Similarly, Comlek et al.40 used a latent variable GP to
search over a library of nearly 48,000 metal−organic frameworks
(MOFs), optimizing for CO2 working capacity and CO2/N2
selectivity using an expected maximin improvement acquisition
strategy. MolPAL57 extends these ideas by offering a flexible
active learning platform for library-based BO. It supports various
multiobjective acquisition strategies and offers diversity-based
pruning in both property and design spaces, including batch
selection via top-k ranking, k-means clustering in property space,
and dissimilarity-based clustering in design space. However, like
many such platforms, batch selection is heuristic. More broadly,
library-based BO is fundamentally constrained by the scope of
the candidate pool. While effective when the library is tractable
in memory, this class of methods cannot propose truly novel
structures and often misses promising regions of chemical space
not captured in the initial enumeration.
2.2. Generative Methods Coupled with BO. 2.2.1. La-
tent-Optimize-Then-Decode Frameworks. A common ap-
proach for coupling generative modeling with BO involves
embedding discrete structures (such as SMILES strings or
graphs for molecules) into a continuous latent space. BO is then
performed in this latent space, and the optimized latent vectors
are decoded back into the original discrete structures for
evaluation. Gómez-Bombarelli et al.10 pioneered this strategy
using a VAE trained on SMILES strings, combined with GP-
based BO in the learned latent space. Grammar VAE46 extended
this idea by enforcing syntactic constraints during decoding,
thereby improving the rate of chemically valid molecules. More
recently, LOLBO47 introduced a local BO framework that
adaptively refines the latent space around promising regions as
additional data are collected. MLPS58 takes a different approach
by learning a parametric approximation to the entire latent-space
Pareto front prior to decoding.
Although these methods are conceptually appealing, they face
several practical limitations. Decoded molecules are frequently
invalid or redundant, and latent spaces are often high-
dimensional and poorly structured, complicating surrogate
modeling and UQ. These issues are further exacerbated in the
multiobjective setting, where the latent space must meaningfully
represent multiple distinct properties. Batch selection is typically
performed using greedy or heuristic strategies since optimization
over large batches of latent vectors can be computationally
demanding and challenging from an optimization point of view.
2.2.2. Acquisition-Guided Generation in Discrete Spaces.
Other methods bypass latent embeddings altogether and instead
optimize acquisition functions directly over discrete chemical
representations. For example, BOSS59 uses grammar-con-
strained SMILES strings as input, combines them with string
kernels in a GP surrogate, and employs an evolutionary
algorithm to search for high-acquisition candidates.
COMBO60 models the design space as a Cartesian product of
categorical and ordinal variables, defines a Laplacian-based
kernel over this structure, and uses GP-based BO to optimize
over the resulting graph. Amortized BO61 learns a policy
network that can quickly propose high-quality candidates,
effectively amortizing the acquisition maximization step.
GFlowNet-based methods62 learn stochastic generation policies
that sample molecules in proportion to their acquisition-based
reward. Extensions to multiobjective settings63 have also been
recently proposed.
These methods offer several advantages, including the ability
to directly optimize in a discrete space and more easily avoid
invalid decodings. However, they still face challenges in
maintaining chemical plausibility, navigating complex and highly

nonconvex search spaces, and scaling effectively to large batch
sizes.
2.3. Generative Optimization without BO. A broad
range of molecular design methods has been developed outside
the BO framework. GAs are a longstanding example. GB-GA64
evolves molecular graphs using mutation and crossover while
preserving chemical validity. JANUS65 combines a parallel-
tempered GA with a deep neural network for active learning and
demonstrates strong performance across logP and docking
benchmarks.
RL methods offer another powerful paradigm for exploring
molecular design spaces. MolDQN66 frames molecular editing
as a Markov decision process and applies Q-learning to optimize
scalarized multiobjective rewards. GraphAF67 combines autor-
egressive flow models with policy gradients to generate
molecules with optimized properties. PGFS68 focuses on
synthesizable molecules by navigating reaction spaces directly,
while REINVENT69 uses recurrent neural networks trained on
SMILES to generate candidates through RL. Recent work by SV
et al.26 adapts AlphaZero to molecular optimization using
Monte Carlo tree search and a fast, machine-learning-derived
surrogate objective, showing relatively strong performance even
in multiobjective settings.
Although these methods are capable of generating diverse and
chemically valid structures, they often require a large number of
evaluations per run, making them less practical for high-fidelity
simulations or experiments. This lack of sample efficiency is a
primary reason we focus instead on BO-based frameworks that
explicitly model epistemic uncertainty (i.e., the lack of
knowledge on the structure-to-property mapping) to try to
make the most out of each evaluation.
2.4. Our Contributions. This work introduces a “generate-
then-optimize” framework for de novo multiobjective molecular
design that decouples the generation of candidate structures
from the process of selecting which ones to evaluate. In contrast
to latent-space BO methods, which require tight coupling
among encoders, decoders, and the surrogate models for
property prediction, our approach maintains modularity
between components. This flexibility allows the use of any
combination of generative model and probabilistic property
predictor and it enables principled acquisition-based selection
over arbitrary molecular representations. By decoupling
generation from optimization, the proposed framework takes a
major step toward the development of scalable, general-purpose
tools for sample-efficient discovery in open-ended chemical
spaces. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
• We generalize the idea of using an RL-based generator
followed by a surrogate-based active learning loop55 into a
modular (generator-agnostic) framework, with a novel
acquisition function built for large, discrete candidate
pools.
• We introduce a new batch acquisition function, called
qPMHI (multipoint Probability of Maximum Hyper-
volume Improvement), that estimates the likelihood of
each candidate maximally expanding the Pareto front.
Because this objective decomposes additively across
candidates (similarly to qPO54), selecting the top-k
acquisition scores yields the exact optimal batch, avoiding
the need for combinatorial optimization.
• We develop a scalable implementation of qPMHI that
supports selection from large candidate pools (tens of
thousands of molecules or more) on a single GPU.
• We conduct single- and multiobjective benchmarks
comparing the proposed framework to existing (state-
of-the-art) BO-based and generative optimization meth-
ods.
• We demonstrate the practical utility of our method
through a realistic case study in sustainable energy
storage, where we accelerate the discovery of high-
performance quinone-based OEMs for aqueous RFB
applications.
3. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
3.1. Problem Formulation. We consider the problem of
MOO over molecular structures:
µ
f x
x
x
f
f
max ( )
(
( ),
,
( ))
x
M
(1)
(
)
=
(1)
where x denotes a molecule drawn from the molecular design
space
and f:
M is a vector-valued objective function
composed of M scalar properties. Each f
:
m
( )
represents
a distinct target property that, without loss of generality, we wish
to maximize. We assume all objectives are black boxes and
expensive to evaluate. While we focus on the noise-free case for
simplicity, extensions to noisy evaluations are straightforward.
We adopt the standard Pareto dominance criterion: a
molecule x dominates another x′ if it performs at least as well
in all objectives and is strictly better in at least one. That is, f(x)
≻f(x′) if and only if f(m)(x) ≥f(m)(x′) for all m ∈{1,..., and M}
and there exists m′ such that f(m′)(x) > f(m′)(x′). Completely
solving problem (1) would require us to identify the exact
Pareto-optimal objective set and corresponding molecules:
x
f x
: ( )
* = {
*}
(2b)
This Pareto frontier provides the trade-off surface from which
a decision-maker can select a solution that adequately balances
competing objectives based on downstream constraints and/or
preferences. In principle, the search space
represents all valid
molecules (e.g., satisfying chemical valence rules, synthesiz-
ability constraints, etc.); however, in the de novo setting, this
space is too vast to enumerate explicitly, and its size is often
unknown or even unbounded. Thus, it should be viewed as a
theoretical construct; our practical goal is not to search it
exhaustively but to identify a diverse set of high-performing
candidates that meaningfully improve upon the existing
(currently known) Pareto front.
Because direct evaluation of f is costly and
cannot be
exhaustively searched, we adopt a surrogate-based sequential
learning strategy, namely BO. BO constructs a probabilistic
model (typically a GP, but any surrogate that predicts a
distribution over outcomes can be used) to approximate the
posterior
f(
)
|
over objective values where

current set of observations. An acquisition function α is then
optimized to select a batch of q new candidates that are expected
to be informative:
argmax
(
)
q
acq
,
cand
cand
cand
=
|
|=
(3)
After querying f at all selected x
acq, the dataset is updated,
and the surrogate model is retrained (either from scratch or fine-
tuned). This loop continues until the evaluation budget is
exhausted or convergence is reached.

Batch selection is particularly important in modern molecular
discovery workflows, where parallel resources are often available.
High-throughput simulations, multicore computing, and ex-
perimental setups (like 96-well plates) all benefit from
simultaneously evaluating multiple candidates. However,
choosing an informative and diverse batch remains one of the
most computationally challenging steps in BO, especially in the
multiobjective setting. Evaluating the batch acquisition function
α is already nontrivial. For example, multipoint Expected
Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI)37 involves computing
expectations over the joint surrogate posterior across the batch.
While gradient-based approximations exist and can be effective
in continuous spaces with smooth, differentiable inputs, they are
more costly than their single-objective counterparts and rely on
local optimization techniques that can lead to suboptimal or
redundant selections. These challenges are magnified in discrete
molecular spaces, where gradients are unavailable and the
candidate space lacks a convenient parametric form. One
workaround is to embed molecules into a continuous latent
space using, e.g., a VAE and perform BO in this latent space.
However, this introduces new difficulties, including poorly
structured latent regions, low decoder validity, and the need for
tight coupling among the encoder, decoder, and property
predictor.
To bypass these limitations, we adopt a two-stage alternative,
involving an initial generation step followed by an optimization
(or selection) step, described in the next two sections.
3.2. Stage 1: Generative Proposal of Candidate
Molecules. Our goal is generative optimization, meaning
that, at each iteration, we construct a fresh, finite pool
from which the Stage 2 selector chooses an evaluation batch.
The framework is generator-agnostic (and composable); i.e., it
can interface with any type of molecular generator or
combinations of generators. See Supporting Information
(Section S1) for a more detailed discussion of generative
methods. By rebuilding
at each iteration, we are continuously
building novel molecules with targeted exploration around
promising scaffolds. In our experiments, we instantiate Stage 1
with several options, including a lightweight surrogate-guided
GA operating on SMILES strings; implementation details
appear in Section 4 and the Supporting Information (Section
S2.2).
The size of
is a tunable parameter. The main idea in this
work is that we can easily create molecules on the order of 104 to
106 using existing (relatively inexpensive) generators. However,
we cannot evaluate the true objective function f, which requires a
high-fidelity simulation or wet-lab experiment, across the full
ever (much less at every iteration). Thus, Stage 2 of our
framework performs this down-selection to a practical batch size
q (typically between tens and hundreds) for evaluation. The
most effective pool would be the one that best balances the
exploitation of current high-performers and the exploration of
the unknown parts of the chemical space. Enforcing this balance
in the generator itself can be quite nontrivial, as it is inherently
challenging to deal with the discrete, multiobjective nature of the
problem. By decoupling generation (diverse, valid proposal)
from selection (acquisition-driven subset choice), we argue that
the generator can play to its strengths while Stage 2 handles the
combinatorial decision-making.
Note that ensuring the validity and synthesizability of the
generated molecules is important in practice but outside the
scope of this paper. We treat Stage 1 as a plug-in interface that
can incorporate validity-enforcing representations, synthesiz-
ability-aware generators, and/or post hoc filters as they mature
(e.g., projecting candidates into synthesizable chemical space70).
Future advances in this area can be adopted with no change to
Stage 2, effectively upgrading the proposal mechanism while
retaining the multiobjective BO-based selector. Our results
suggest that, given a fixed generator, our two-stage framework
can consistently improve selection quality and, in turn,
identification of higher-quality candidates.
3.3. Stage 2: Batch Optimal Candidate Selection. The
hypervolume of a finite approximation of the Pareto set
is
defined as
i

M

(4)
where r
M is a dominated reference point (chosen such that
every incumbent objective vector on the Pareto front dominates
it), [r, y] is the hyper-rectangle spanned by r and y, and λM
denotes the M-dimensional Lebesgue measure. For a new
candidate x with unknown objectives f(x), its hypervolume
improvement (HVI) relative to the current front
is

where we omit the dependence on

proposed (batch-level) acquisition function, qPMHI (multi-
point Probability of Maximum Hypervolume Improvement), is
then defined as

where

q
cand

surrogate posteriors are continuous with small but nonzero
noise, the probability of ties in HVI values is zero, and thus the
events x
x

HV( )

This allows the acquisition score to be decomposed into a simple

This additive structure enables batch selection via simple
ranking, i.e.,we can compute p(x) for each candidate in
and
choose the top-q with the highest probability. As a result,
increasing the batch size, q, incurs no combinatorial overhead.
Note that
x

It is useful to compare qPMHI to one of the most popular
MOO
acquisition functions,
qEHVI,
defined

on the joint distribution of f(

cand , optimizing it requires
searching over all q-sized subsets, which is especially difficult in
discrete domains (as the size grows exponentially with q). By
contrast, qPMHI avoids this bottleneck by reducing the
acquisition evaluation to independent candidate-wise proba-
bilities.

To estimate p(x) in practice, we can use Monte Carlo
sampling. Depending on the surrogate model, this can be done
in one of two ways. For parametric models (such as BNNs), we
sample a realization of the model parameters and evaluate the
resulting function on all candidates x
. For GPs, we typically
draw from the joint posterior over the candidate set by
computing the posterior mean and covariance and sampling
from the resulting multivariate normal. An alternative and more
efficient method, described by Wilson et al.,71 uses a hybrid
function-space and weight-space representation via random
Fourier features, and applies to any covariance function with a
known spectral decomposition. In either case, we draw L

We can interpret qPMHI as an extension of the recent qPO
acquisition54 to the MOO setting. In fact, qPMHI simplifies to
qPO when we replace the HVI metric with one that measures
improvement in the single-objective optimal value over the
discrete candidate set.
3.4. Workflow Integration and Iterative Loop. Algo-
rithm 1 summarizes the complete generative multiobjective
batch BO procedure using the proposed qPMHI acquisition
function. Each iteration begins by updating the probabilistic
surrogate model using all available labeled property data (Line
2). The generator may optionally be updated using this same
data (Line 3), which is important for ensuring the “on-the-fly”
generated pool of candidates
t is well aligned with the
multiobjective learning task. Stage 1 (the generative proposal
step) is executed in Line 4, while Stage 2 (the optimization and
selection step) is carried out in Lines 5−13. Note that the
function top-k({xi, yi}i=1
N , k) in Line 13 sorts the N input−output
pairs by their scalar output values in descending order and
returns the top k associated inputs. This procedure is trivially
parallelizable and scales well with both batch size q and pool size
N. The final step (Line 14) involves querying the expensive
oracle f to evaluate the selected candidates and augmenting the
dataset with these newly acquired labels/measurements. This
iterative process continues until a fixed number of iterations T is
completed or until another user-defined stopping criterion is
met (easily incorporated at the end of each iteration).
A key practical consideration is that fewer than q candidates
may have a nonzero probability of achieving the maximum HVI.
In such cases, instead of directly taking the top-q candidates in
Line 13, we recommend a simple fallback: populate the
remainder of the batch by using the candidates with the highest
probability of lying on the Pareto front. Although this strategy
lacks the additive decomposability property that enables
qPMHI’s efficient ranking-based optimization procedure, it is
easy to implement, and we found it to provide relatively strong
empirical performance. Studying more principled alternatives
especially those with theoretical guaranteesis an interesting
direction for future research.
Finally, domain-specific constraints can be readily incorpo-
rated into the workflow. For known constraints (such as bounds
on molecular weight or violations of chemical valency), filtering
can be applied during generation by rejecting infeasible
candidates in Stage 1. For black-box constraints on unknown
properties (e.g., toxicity or solubility), a constrained variant of
qPMHI can be used in Stage 2. This involves modifying the
maximization step in (6) to restrict attention to candidates
predicted to satisfy all constraints under the surrogate model.
Because qPMHI relies on sample-based approximations, such
constraints can be enforced on a per-sample basis within each
Monte Carlo draw. Importantly, this does not affect the overall
structure of the acquisition function; i.e., the resulting
constrained variant still satisfies the additive decomposability
property that enables efficient batch selection.
4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed
framework for generative multiobjective batch BO on two case
studies. The first is a modified version of a widely used
benchmark in molecular optimization focused on drug-like
molecule discovery. The second highlights the applicability of
our approach to a practical energy storage problem: the design of
OEMs for aqueous RFBs. We target simultaneous optimization
of the redox potential and aqueous solubility (two properties
linked to device performance and long-term stability) using
state-of-the-art property prediction models trained on domain-
specific data.
The code and data used in the experiments, including an
efficient implementation of Algorithm 1, are available at:

HI. Note that a more detailed description of how the methods
were implemented and some additional results/analyses are
provided in the Supporting Information.

area (TPSA). This setup is adapted from Gómez-Bombarelli et
al.,10 with molecules drawn from ZINC-250k, a curated subset of
the ZINC database.72 Higher logP values are generally
associated with improved membrane permeability, while lower
TPSA values typically reduce the hydrogen bonding capacity
and promote passive diffusion, particularly across the blood-
brain barrier. Because these objectives often conflict in drug
design, they serve as a canonical test case for MOO methods.73
To mitigate known pathologies when logP is optimized in an
unconstrained setting, we enforce two mild constraints: SMILES
string length ≤108 and synthetic accessibility (SAScore)74 ≤8.
Note that these constraints are not intended to reflect realistic
drug discovery criteria but rather to match assumptions in prior
benchmarking work. Both log P and TPSA are computed using
RDKit.75
4.1.2. Baseline Methods. We evaluate four representative
baselines spanning different molecular optimization strategies:
(i) VAE+BO,10 a latent optimize-then-decode framework using
a VAE generator and qEHVI acquisition; (ii) JANUS,65 a
parallel-tempered GA guided by an internal property predictor;
(iii) Graph-GA,76 a GA-based method operating over molecular
graphs; and (iv) MolDQN,66 a deep RL method that applies Q-
learning to molecular graph edits.
JANUS, Graph-GA, and MolDQN are single-objective by
default, so we optimize a composite objective given by the
equally weighted sum of min-max normalized log P and TPSA
values (based on the initial data). Notably, Graph-GA ranked
second overall in a recent benchmark study by Gao et al.77 The
top-ranked method, REINVENT,69 relies on a recurrent neural
network (RNN) trained on SMILES from the ChEMBL
database;78 since this differs from our ZINC-250k-based
setup, we evaluate REINVENT separately in Section S4 of the
Supporting Information.
4.1.3. Implementation Details and Setup. Each method is
run for T = 20 iterations with a batch size of q = 50. The initial
training set
0 consists of 2000 randomly sampled molecules
from ZINC-250k. All methods are evaluated over five
independent trials, with matched random seeds to ensure a
fair comparison.
Our approach uses L = 256 Monte Carlo samples to estimate
acquisition scores, and a candidate pool size of N = 5000 per
iteration. The surrogate model is a custom Bayesian graph neural
network (BGNN) adapted from Ramani and Karmakar,79 which
we implemented in torchbnn with post-training variance
calibration following Rasmussen et al.80 For candidate
generation, we adopt a GA inspired by the STONED method,81
which leverages the surrogate to attempt to balance exploration
and exploitation. We denote this as Ours (GA/BGNN). To
highlight the importance of generator choice, we also include a
variant Ours (VAE/GP) that mirrors the VAE+BO setup within
our framework (i.e., uses the exact same VAE generator and GP
surrogate).
Additional implementation details, including hyperparameter
settings, are provided in Section S2 of the Supporting
Information. For all baselines, we preserve default settings or
recommended settings from the original open-source reposito-
ries. While the hyperparameter values are expected to impact the
results, exhaustive hyperparameter tuning is impractical and
beyond the scope of this study. We also note that the per-
iteration computational cost for all methods in this benchmark is
summarized in Section S2.3 of the Supporting Information; it is
on the order of minutes for all methods, which is negligible when
compared to realistic settings where oracles are expensive
simulations or experiments.
4.1.4. Pareto Optimization Results. Figure 2 shows the
evolution of the hypervolume over 20 optimization iterations.
Hypervolume is measured with respect to a fixed reference
point, defined as the nadir of the initial sample set. Each curve
reports the mean over five trials; shaded regions denote 95%
confidence intervals. Our method consistently achieves the
highest hypervolume across all iterations, expanding the Pareto
front more rapidly and comprehensively than the baselines (see
also Table 1). Graph-GA performs similarly to JANUS, and both
clearly outperform MolDQN, VAE+BO, and Ours (VAE/GP).
These results underscore the importance of the generator:
overly greedy or narrow strategies can hinder effective trade-off
exploration in MOO settings.
Figure 3 visualizes the final Pareto fronts (best trial per
method). Our method uncovers a substantially broader frontier,
including molecules with log P > 20, well beyond the reach of
other approaches. In contrast, JANUS rarely finds candidates
with log P > 5, reflecting its conservative sampling. This
demonstrates our method’s ability to identify both balanced and
extreme trade-offs by explicitly targeting frontier expansion.
To further illustrate this behavior, Figure 4 plots the evolution
of our batch selections across three iterations (5, 10, and 20),
overlaid on the initial data distribution. The selected molecules
progressively expand into unexplored regions while maintaining
diversity across the trade-off surface. This highlights how our
acquisition strategy encourages both exploration and broad
Pareto coverage.
4.1.5. Impact of qPMHI Acquisition Function. We now
isolate the effect of our proposed qPMHI acquisition function.
To do so, we fix all other components: the surrogate is a BGNN
trained on 500 labeled molecules randomly drawn from ZINC-
250k, and the candidate pool consists of a prefixed 20,000
generated molecules based on random fragment combinations
over ZINC-250k. We compare qPMHI to three alternatives: (i)
qEHVI, (ii) qPOTS82 (a multiobjective Thompson sampling
method), and (iii) Sobol sampling. All acquisitions are
implemented using BoTorch,83 following current best
practices for large-batch optimization.
Figure 5 shows the hypervolume progression over 20
iterations (batch size q = 100), along with the mean fraction
of true Pareto points recovered. Across all trials, qPMHI
outperforms the other methods across all seeds and iterations,
achieving higher Hypervolume and recovering a larger fraction

hypervolume achieved by a method (batch size q = 50), with shaded
bands denoting 95% confidence intervals. Our method achieves the
highest hypervolume at each step.

of the global Pareto front. These results confirm the sampling
efficiency of our new acquisition, particularly in large-batch,
discrete MOO settings.
4.2. Design of OEMs. 4.2.1. Problem Description. Quinone
derivatives have emerged as promising redox-active materials for
next-generation aqueous battery cathodes due to their high
theoretical capacities, molecular tunability, and potential for
sustainable synthesis.84 Aqueous RFBs employing such
materials are particularly attractive for grid-scale energy storage,
offering intrinsic safety, low cost, and independent scaling of
energy and power capacity.85−87 However, long-term stability
remains a key challenge, as molecular degradation and active
species crossover can severely limit capacity retention.
Identifying stable, high-voltage, redox-active molecules with
low aqueous solubility is therefore critical to advancing practical
organic RFB technologies.
To ground our study in realistic chemistry, we leverage the
large-scale dataset generated by Tabor et al.,88 which contains
two-electron redox potentials for over 130,000 small organic
molecules (estimated via density functional theory (DFT)),
including a broad set of quinones. We use this full dataset to train
a BGNN surrogate to predict the redox potential Ered directly
from molecular structure, enabling fast evaluation of new,
previously unseen candidates. Aqueous solubility S is predicted
using FastSolv,89 a recently proposed ML model that provides
temperature-dependent solubility estimates across a wide
solvent range.
Importantly, while our property predictors are trained on
existing databases, the molecules generated and evaluated
during optimization are entirely novel and lie outside the
training set. Our generator is designed to construct new,
synthetically plausible molecules by modifying and recombining
fragments, not to sample directly from the original database (as
in traditional screening). This capability is central to our
framework and allows us to search large, constrained design
spaces where surrogate model guidance is essential.
Because ground truth values for Ered and S are unavailable for
newly generated molecules, we rely on surrogate model
predictions during optimization. The overall quality of the
proposed designs is therefore limited by the accuracy and
uncertainty of these models, a practical constraint that mirrors
real-world discovery settings. Although our method is capable of
generating high-performing candidates, our primary contribu-
tion is methodological; we do not claim to have discovered
superior molecules immediately ready for experimental testing.
The DFT-calculated redox potentials in the training data are
known to be approximate,88 and as such, downstream
conclusions should be interpreted accordingly. Our goal is to
show that the proposed framework can accelerate molecular
design campaigns and improve search efficiency in realistic
chemical spaces. This is a common strategy for benchmarking in
the generative molecular optimization literature (see, e.g.,
Experiment II in Griffiths et al.90).
4.2.2. Baseline Methods. For this case study, we compare our
method to two relevant baselines: JANUS65 and FASMIFRA.91
JANUS was a top performer in earlier benchmarks and served as
a strong, optimization-based baseline. In contrast, FASMIFRA is
a property-agnostic fragment recombination method that
randomly assembles new molecules based on learned fragment
distributions. This provides a naive structural baseline, useful for
quantifying the impact of a property-guided search. Other
methods were excluded due to their difficulty in handling
structural and synthetic constraints specific to this domain. We
restrict the search space to molecules containing a para-, ortho-,
or anthraquinone core, consistent with design motifs used in
aqueous RFB cathodes and well-represented in the training data.
Additional filters are imposed to ensure chemical validity and
synthetic plausibility (see Section 4.2.3).

4.2.3. Implementation Details and Setup. We adopt the
general framework from Section 4.1, but we adapt it to reflect the
increased realism of this domain. The initial dataset
0 consists
of 20,000 molecules sampled from the Tabor et al. library,
covering a broad spectrum of quinone derivatives. Optimization
is conducted for T = 30 iterations. Our GA generator is modified
to enforce domain constraints: all molecules contain a valid
quinone core, and genetic operations are restricted to specified
attachment points. We further filter molecules to have
SAScores74 below 7 and no more than six ring structures.
These constraints ensure that generated molecules are chemi-
cally reasonable and remain within the space of likely
synthesizable structures. These choices demonstrate the
flexibility of our framework: we show that constrained,
chemically meaningful molecule generation can be achieved
without requiring complex generative models, and that domain
knowledge can be directly encoded into the generation pipeline.
JANUS is applied as in the previous section, optimizing an
equally weighted scalarization of Ered and log S based on min-
max normalized training data. FASMIFRA is executed with its
default settings, generating a batch of candidates at each
iteration and randomly selecting the first q = 50 that meet all of
the validity and constraint checks.
4.2.4. Surrogate Model Performance. We assess the
surrogate model performance in this realistic setting using four
modeling approaches. Our proposed model, a BGNN with
attention over gated recurrent units (GRUs), is compared to an
ablated BGNN without attention and to two Bayesian multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) using either Mordred descriptors92 or
ChemBERTa embeddings.93 Figure 6 summarizes the results.
The proposed BGNN with attention achieves the lowest
rootmean squared error (RMSE) and the most accurate
uncertainty calibration (using the suggested metric from
Rasmussen et al.80) for both Ered and log S on a held-out test
set of 15,000 molecules randomly sampled from the Tabor et
al.88 dataset. These results indicate the model’s strong ability to
generalize in a domain-constrained setting and support its use in
guiding search.
4.2.5. Pareto Optimization Results. Figure 7 shows the
relative HVI for all three optimization trials, defined as
r

, where
t is the Pareto
set at iteration t. Our method (GA/BGNN) achieves the
greatest final HVI in each trial, demonstrating robust improve-
ments over both JANUS and FASMIFRA despite the con-
strained and chemically challenging search space. Final HVI
values and relative gains are listed in Table 2. The relative
improvements are smaller than in the earlier logP-TPSA
benchmark, which is expected: (i) the starting dataset is larger
and already contains high-quality designs, and (ii) the domain
constraints significantly restrict exploration. Nonetheless, our
approach consistently expands the initial Pareto front, validating
its ability to operate under realistic chemical constraints.
Figure 8 visualizes the final Pareto fronts and representative
molecules from the best-performing trial. Our method discovers
new candidates that occupy previously unexplored regions of the
redox-solubility trade-off space. Although we do not perform
DFT or experimental validation, we note that two of the three
structures depicted in Figure 8 were identified as likely
synthesizable by a synthetic chemist (the molecules with
redox values of 1.39 and 1.62, though the synthetic routes

remain uncertain). This highlights a broader challenge in
molecular design: even when molecules appear chemically
plausible, synthesis remains a major bottleneck due to a lack of
predictive synthesis planning tools. Addressing this challenge
lies outside the scope of this study, but it is an important open
problem for the community.
4.3. Limitations and Future Work. This work introduces a
modular “generate-then-optimize” workflow and a new
acquisition function, qPMHI, designed to improve candidate
selection in multiobjective molecular design. While our primary
goal was to establish the efficacy of this methodological
framework, several limitations and directions for future research
merit further discussion.
Stage 1 (the generator) fundamentally shapes what the
optimizer can explore. Our framework does not require a large
starting database: only a generator and a small set of labeled

held-out test set of 15,000 molecules; the bottom row shows the root mean squared error (RMSE) versus root mean variance (RMV) computed over
bins sorted by predicted uncertainty.80 An ideal model should exhibit a linear one-to-one relationship (dashed line), indicating well-calibrated
predictive uncertainties. Our proposed model (BGNN with attention, leftmost) consistently achieves the lowest RMSE and best uncertainty
calibration (R2 = 0.85 for redox, R2 = 0.81 for logS), outperforming all baselines.

molecules to train a surrogate. In practice, generators benefit
from seeding (e.g., pretraining on generic corpora, initializing
with domain scaffolds, or sampling via robust encodings, such as
SELFIES with filters). However, generators can drift toward
syntactically valid but unrealistic regions, particularly in
unconstrained de novo discovery settings. We addressed this
through pragmatic filters in our case studies (e.g., attachment
restrictions around quinone cores), but stronger feasibility
constraints (such as synthetic accessibility metrics, retrosyn-
thetic route planning, and stability checks) can be integrated
directly into Stage 1 or treated as additional objectives. As tools
like e.g., SPARROW94 mature, combining molecular and route
design in a unified optimization loop becomes increasingly
feasible.
Stage 2 depends on a probabilistic surrogate to score large
batches of proposed molecules. While we demonstrated that
different surrogates (e.g., BGNNs, GPs) can be used effectively,
there is no single best model across properties, molecular
representations, or data regimes. Improved strategies for model
selection, calibration, and ensembling, potentially incorporating
multifidelity or cost-aware formulations, are important exten-
sions. Additionally, because our method is oracle-agnostic, any
biases or noise in the underlying property estimator (e.g., DFT
errors, surrogate mismatch, and experimental variability) will
propagate to the selection process. We did not re-evaluate
proposed molecules at higher fidelity in this work; such
validation is a natural next step when targeting a specific
application.

JANUS (dashed purple) and the property-unaware baseline FASMIFRA (dot-dashed orange), demonstrating its ability to expand the Pareto front
even under structural and synthetic constraints.

Our implementation prioritizes proof-of-concept rather than
computational efficiency. Per-iteration wall-clock times (Section
S2.3 of the Supporting Information) are small relative to
expensive simulations or experiments, but our code is not
optimized and does not leverage full parallelization. More
broadly, a time-aware formulation that allocates resources
between candidate generation, surrogate training, and acquis-
ition maximization would increase practical utility, especially in
settings with fast or heterogeneous oracles.
Finally, the generate-then-optimize paradigm generalizes
beyond small-molecule design. Because it operates over graph-
or sequence-based representations and cleanly separates
generation/proposal from selection, the same workflow could
apply to polymers, inorganic materials, reaction networks, or
even string-based process synthesis. These broader domains
present new challenges in representation, feasibility, and scoring,
but they also highlight the flexibility of the proposed approach
and its potential to serve as a foundation for scalable design
pipelines across chemistry, materials science, and beyond.
5. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we introduce a modular framework for de novo
multiobjective molecular design that decouples candidate
generation from selection. This “generate-then-optimize”
structure supports diverse generative models and probabilistic
surrogates while enabling principled selection via a new batch
acquisition function, qPMHI. By ranking candidates according
to their probability of delivering the maximum hypervolume
improvement, qPMHI permits exact batch selection through
simple sorting, avoiding a combinatorial search.
Across two benchmark problems (one focused more on drug-
like molecule discovery and the other on the design of OEMs),
our framework consistently identified higher-quality Pareto
fronts than strong baseline methods. Furthermore, we
consistently observe that pairing qPMHI with any generator
results in performance improvements, highlighting the benefits
of decoupled generation and selection. The modularity of the
proposed framework also ensures compatibility with emerging
models, allowing users to straightforwardly incorporate
improved generators or surrogates without rearchitecting the
pipeline.
To our knowledge, this is the first generative multiobjective
BO approach that naturally supports high-throughput batch
selection, making it compatible with parallel experimental
platforms (e.g., multiwell screening arrays) and high-perform-
ance computing environments for large-scale simulation
campaigns. Together, the presented results suggest that
separating large-scale proposals from uncertainty-aware batch-
wise selection is a powerful organizing principle for generative
optimization in chemistry and beyond.
