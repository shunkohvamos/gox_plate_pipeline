A longstanding idea in evolutionary physiology is that an enzyme cannot jointly optimize performance at both high and low
temperatures due to a trade-off between stability and activity. Although a stability-activity trade-off has been observed for
well-characterized examples, such a trade-off is not imposed by any physical chemical constraint. To better understand the
pervasiveness of this trade-off, I investigated the stability-activity relationship for comparative biochemical studies of puriﬁed
orthologous enzymes identiﬁed by a literature search. The nature of this relationship varied greatly among studies. Notably,
studies of enzymes with low mean synonymous nucleotide sequence divergence were less likely to exhibit the predicted negative
correlation between stability and activity. Similarly, a survey of directed evolution investigations of the stability-activity relationship
indicated that these traits are often uncoupled among nearly identical yet phenotypically divergent enzymes. This suggests that
the presumptive trade-off often reported for investigations of enzymes with high mean sequence divergence may in some cases
instead be a consequence of the degeneration over time of enzyme function in unselected environments, rather than a direct effect
of thermal adaptation. The results caution against the general assertion of a stability-activity trade-off during enzyme adaptation.

Enzymes are the principal biological catalysts that speed up chem-
ical reactions primarily by lowering the activation energy barrier
to converting reactants into products through the stabilization
of the transition state (Garcia-Viloca et al. 2004). They are in-
trinsically flexible, dynamic macromolecules with internal mo-
tions that are necessary for the binding of substrates, the release
of products and, potentially, the mechanism of catalysis itself
(Hammes-Schiffer and Benkovic 2006; Henzler-Wildman et al.
2007). Enzymes are also typically only marginally stable: the
properly folded, functionally active ensemble of an enzyme’s
conformations (i.e., the native state) is only slightly energeti-
cally favored over the unfolded state at physiological temperatures
(Wintrode and Arnold 2001; Hochachka and Somero 2002). The
maintenance of enzyme structure and activity is therefore thought
to arise from a delicate balance of stability and flexibility.
Orthologous enzymes from ectotherms adapted to different
temperatures often vary in their thermal stabilities, with enzymes
from organisms that live in high temperature environments ex-
hibiting greater resistance to unfolding. It is commonly asserted
that the mechanism responsible for this enhanced stability is a
decrease in flexibility (i.e., increased rigidity) and that, conse-
quently, a more thermostable enzyme is expected to be a slower
catalyst than a less stable ortholog at low temperature (Somero
1995; Arnold et al. 2001; Hochachka and Somero 2002; DePristo
et al. 2005; Feller 2010). Under this view, natural selection is
predicted to compensate for differences in environmental tem-
perature such that an enzyme’s binding and catalytic abilities are
conserved at the respective physiological temperatures of taxa
(Jaenicke and Z´avodszky 1990; Jaenicke 1991; Somero 1995;
Z´avodszky et al. 1998; Fields 2001).
This presumed trade-off between an enzyme’s resistance to
unfolding and its ability to perform the conformational changes
required for catalysis has been a powerful idea in evolutionary
physiology, and there are many reports of a stability-activity
trade-off in the literature. Most notably, these include lactate de-
hydrogenases from fish and marine invertebrates adapted to dif-
ferent temperatures (reviewed by Fields (2001) and Hochachka
and Somero (2002)) as well as enzymes from mesophilic versus

extremophilic microorganisms (reviewed by Sterner and Liebel
(2001) and Feller (2010)). Despite these examples, however, the
generality of a trade-off between enzyme stability and activity
remains unclear, and there are both theoretical and empirical rea-
sons to believe that the relationship between these traits may be
more complicated.
Thermodynamically, whether an enzyme remains stably
folded at a given temperature T is determined by the difference in
free energy between its folded and unfolded states (i.e., the free en-
ergy of stabilization, Gstab), with Gstab > 0 favoring the folded
state (Becktel and Schellmann 1987). Gstab is a function of the
differences between the folded and unfolded states in enthalpy
(H0), entropy (S0), and heat capacity (Cp), respectively:
Gstab = H 0 −TS0 + Cp

T −T 0 −T ln

T/T 0
,
(1)
where T0 is a reference temperature (Becktel and Schellmann
1987). Stability and activity are only expected to be correlated
if increased thermal stability (i.e., an increase in the tempera-
ture Tm at which G = 0) is conferred by a decrease in enzyme
flexibility. Many thermostable enzymes do appear to have lower
global flexibility than less stable homologs based on lower rates of
molecular motion when measured at the same temperature, for ex-
ample, by hydrogen/deuterium exchange (Z´avodszky et al. 1998;
Wintrode and Arnold 2001; Karshikoff et al. 2015). Protein sta-
bility and rigidity may both increase via an increase in H, such
as by the addition of a hydrogen bond (Razvi and Scholtz 2006).
For example, the greater stability of the histone from Methanoth-
ermus fervidus, a hyperthermophile, compared with that from the
mesophilic Methanobacterium formicum is due to enthalpic changes,
including the addition of ion pairs and enhanced hydrophobic in-
teractions in the former (Li et al. 2000).
However, it is evident from equation (1) above that stability
may also evolve through a reduction in S and/or Cp (Kumar
and Nussinov 2001; Sawle and Ghosh 2011), which can produce
a more thermostable enzyme without an accompanying decrease
in flexibility (Daniel et al. 2003; Karshikoff et al. 2015). In fact, a
more thermostable enzyme may be more flexible than a less stable
homolog if S is reduced by an increase in the conformational
entropy of the native state, whereby there are a greater number
of accessible substates without initiation of unfolding compared
with a less stable enzyme (Lazaridis et al. 1997; Karshikoff et al.
2015). Indeed, both experimental investigations and molecular
dynamics simulation studies of protein motions over a range
of time scales have demonstrated that more thermostable pro-
teins are not necessarily less flexible than less stable homologs
(Hernandez et al. 2000; Jaenicke 2000; Merkley et al. 2010; Sawle
and Ghosh 2011; Karshikoff et al. 2015). For example, rubre-
doxin from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus exhibits
flexibility comparable to proteins of mesophilic organisms de-
spite an extraordinarily low unfolding rate at 100°C (Hern´andez
et al. 2000). Furthermore, if enzyme flexibility systematically
decreased with stability, then one would expect the temperature
dependence (Q10) of enzyme catalytic rates to decrease with in-
creasing physiological temperature; however, there is no evidence
for a systematic difference in Q10 values for enzymes that operate
at low, moderate, and high temperatures in nature, respectively
(Elias et al. 2014).
Other, historical factors may complicate the relationships
among stability, flexibility, and activity. For example, the process
of thermodynamic stabilization need not be homogeneous over
time. Taking an ancestral protein resurrection approach, Hart et al.
(2014) reported that the underlying thermodynamic mechanisms
of stabilization have varied among lineages during the evolution-
ary history of bacterial ribonuclease H1. In addition, aspects of
enzyme activity may be subject to other selective pressures be-
sides temperature. Both the enzyme catalytic turnover number
(kcat) and the Michaelis constant (Km), a measure of an enzyme’s
substrate affinity, are often assumed to be negatively correlated
with stability based on the proposed mechanism that a more stable
and rigid enzyme both binds its substrate(s) more tightly (lower
Km) and is a slower catalyst (lower kcat; Somero 1995; Arnold
et al. 2001; Hochachka and Somero 2002). However, both may be
influenced by selection on the specificity of substrate preference,
quantified by the ratio kcat/Km, as well as the substrate concentra-
tion available to an enzyme. This can complicate the inference of
the mechanisms responsible for changes in activity, particularly if
selection varies among lineages, e.g. along a specialist-generalist
axis. In this light, an interesting observation is that ancient recon-
structed enzymes appear to be both more thermostable and more
promiscuous with respect to substrate utilization than modern en-
zymes (Risso et al. 2013; Romero-Romero et al. 2016; Trudeau
et al. 2016; Wheeler et al. 2016).
Finally, there are many examples of the absence of a stability-
activity trade-off among both engineered and natural enzymes.
Enzymes engineered to be more thermostable in vitro sometimes
evolve without a cost of reduced activity at cold temperature
(Arnold et al. 2001). Among natural enzymes, a decoupling of
stability and activity has been reported for lactate dehydroge-
nases of several fish species (Fields and Somero 1997; Holland
et al. 1997) and congeneric porcelain crabs (Stillman and Somero
2001), for example. Because a stability-activity trade-off may im-
pose costs for organismal performance at physiological extremes,
it has the potential to drive the processes of ecological special-
ization and niche differentiation along environmental gradients,
shape biogeographical patterns, and impact the evolutionary re-
sponses of taxa to climate change (Chown et al. 2010; Somero
2010). Addressing the prevalence of the trade-off for enzymes
in nature is therefore essential. Here, I tested the prediction of
the trade-off mechanism that enzyme stability and activity are

negatively correlated for comparative biochemistry datasets ob-
tained from a comprehensive literature search.
Methods
Identiﬁcation of natural enzyme datasets
Web of Science searches from 1968 through 2016 were performed
under the topic terms (1) “enzyme stability” and “temperature”
and (2) “temperature adaptation” and “protein,” respectively, with
the vast majority of returns from after 1990. To be included in the
analysis, data were required for some measure of both (1) enzyme
stability (e.g., enzyme denaturation temperature, Tm; enzyme op-
timal temperature, Topt; time to 50% enzyme inactivation, T50;
the free energy of unfolding, GU) and (2) kinetics assayed at
a common garden temperature (e.g., enzyme catalytic turnover
number, kcat; the maximal rate of catalysis, Vmax; enzyme-specific
activity; Michaelis constant, Km).
Phylogenetic comparative analysis
Correlations between stability and activity were estimated by phy-
logenetic generalized least squares (Martins and Hansen 1997).
Where possible, FASTA-formatted nucleotide sequence data were
obtained for the sampled enzymes and subsequently aligned
with CLUSTALW (Thompson et al. 1994). Maximum likeli-
hood phylogenies were reconstructed with PAUP∗version 4.0b10
(Swofford 2002) following selection of a model of sequence evo-
lution using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values estimated
with Modeltest (Posada and Crandall 1998). Branch length data
from phylogenies were incorporated into phylogenetic general-
ized least squares models implemented with Compare version
4.6 (http://compare.bio.indiana.edu/). For each model, the alpha
parameter, which indicates the strength of the constraint on phe-
notypic evolution, was optimized from the data by REML for
values of alpha ranging between zero and 15.5. Alpha specifies
how phenotypes of taxa evolve along the phylogeny: a value of
zero corresponds to Brownian motion, whereas, for positive val-
ues, phenotypes evolve by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck “rubber-band”
process. Brownian motion captures the linear decrease in the phe-
notypic covariance of species with increasing phylogenetic dis-
tance that is expected for several microevolutionary processes,
including drift and directional selection, whereas an O-U process
models the exponential decrease expected for traits experienc-
ing stabilizing selection (Hansen and Martins 1996). For datasets
for which sequences were not available or could not be reliably
aligned, but for which a topology was available from other data,
a speciation model was applied with phylogeny branch lengths
set to one. Phenotypic covariance in this model is expected to de-
crease linearly as for other Brownian motion models (Hansen and
Martins 1996). Where available, the models also incorporated
standard error estimates for the enzyme data into the variance
components of the error term. The statistical significance of the
correlation coefficients was assessed by whether the confidence
interval for the slope of the regression line overlapped zero, per
the authors’ recommendation.
Statistical models
r values were rescaled by r/2 + 0.5 to take on values between 0
and 1 and then logit-transformed to make the data approximately
normal. The normality of the transformed distributions was as-
sessed with Shapiro–Wilk tests. Linear random effect and mixed
models of the rescaled logit-transformed data were fit by REML
using Jmp version 10 (SAS Institute).
For datasets for which nucleotide sequences were available
for enzyme-coding genes, average synonymous nucleotide diver-
gence Ks was estimated by the Nei-Gojobori method using DnaSP
version 5 (Librado and Rozas 2009). Samples were assigned to
one of two divergence classes based on whether the average Ks was
less than or greater than 0.25 synonymous nucleotide substitutions
per synonymous site. The average difference in temperature be-
tween a pair of sampled enzymes was also estimated for datasets
with information on the optimal environmental temperature of the
organisms from which the sampled enzymes were derived.
Stability-activity relationship for the directed evolution
of engineered enzymes
To investigate the stability-activity relationship for engineered en-
zymes created by random mutagenesis, I conducted a literature
search between 1995 and 2016 for the search terms “directed evo-
lution” and “stability.” To be included in the analysis, a study was
required to comprehensively screen at least stability or activity
of mutant enzymes and subsequently assess for a trade-off in the
other trait.
Results and Discussion
Datasets and phylogenetic comparative methods
Because the sensitivity of enzyme performance to reaction condi-
tions complicates comparative biochemistry across independent
investigations, only data obtained from the same study were con-
sidered. To be included, data were required for three or more
purified orthologous enzymes for some measure of both (1) en-
zyme stability and (2) enzyme kinetics assayed at a common
garden temperature. For the former, this included enzyme denatu-
ration temperature (Tm), enzyme optimal temperature (Topt), time
to 50% enzyme inactivation (T50) or other estimate of residual ac-
tivity, and the free energy of unfolding (GU). For the latter, this
included enzyme catalytic turnover number (kcat), maximal rate
of catalysis (Vmax), enzyme specific activity, and the Michaelis
constant (Km), a measure of an enzyme’s substrate affinity (1/Km

is related but not identical to enzyme-binding affinity). A negative
relationship between these stability and activity metrics is consis-
tent with a trade-off based on the proposed mechanism that a more
stable and rigid enzyme both binds its substrate(s) more tightly
(lower Km) and is a slower catalyst (lower kcat etc.). Datasets were
obtained from Web of Science searches from 1968 (the year of
Hochachka and Somero’s landmark paper on temperature adap-
tation of enzymes; Hochachka and Somero 1968) through 2016
under the terms (1) “enzyme stability” and “temperature” and (2)
“temperature adaptation” and “protein,” respectively.
Fifty-two datasets from 34 studies for the stability-activity
relationship (Table 1) were identified for analysis. Given the rich
respective histories of research on both thermal physiology and
enzyme biochemistry, it is perhaps surprising how few studies
met the above criteria; frequently, comparative biochemical stud-
ies only involved two enzymes, typically isolated from anciently
divergent taxa.
Comparative phenotypic data from related organisms are ex-
pected to violate the assumptions of standard statistical models in
a manner analogous to the degrees of freedom problem associated
with pseudo-replication, thereby giving false confidence in sig-
nificance tests. Therefore, to conduct correlation analyses, these
assumptions were relaxed with a phylogenetic generalized least
squares (PGLS) approach (Martins and Hansen 1997), which ac-
counts for the statistical dependence of comparative data in the
error term of the model by converting phylogeny branch lengths
into units of expected phenotypic divergence (Methods). When
possible, these branch lengths were estimated from sequence data
for each enzyme in the sample; alternatively, for samples for which
sequences were not available or could not be reliably aligned, but
for which a topology was available from other data, a specia-
tion model was employed in which branch lengths were set equal
to one.
Studies of more divergent enzymes are more likely to
exhibit a negative relationship between stability
and activity
Thirty-nine of the 52 stability-activity PGLS models estimated the
predicted negative correlation (mean r = 0.30), though estimated
values varied greatly and, in most cases, the correlation was weak
and not significant (Fig. 1; Table 1). Because many studies had low
sample size, it is difficult to distinguish the absence of a relation-
ship from a statistical power issue. For further statistical analysis,
estimated r values were rescaled and then logit-transformed to
make them approximately normal as assessed by the Shapiro–
Wilk test (P = 0.17). A linear model with these transformed data
as the response variable and with study as random effect indicated
that a majority of the variation in estimated correlations could be
explained by differences among studies (57.0% of the total REML
variance component estimate).

Figure 1. Frequency distribution of correlation coefﬁcients esti-

the stability-activity relationship indicated in Table 1. An estimated
negative correlation between stability and activity is consistent
with the prediction of a trade-off mechanism. Darker shaded val-
ues indicate estimated correlations that are signiﬁcantly different
from zero.
To further explore the factors contributing to this variation
among studies, two linear mixed models were developed. The
first incorporated sequence divergence as a fixed effect. The av-
erage amount of synonymous nucleotide sequence divergence
(Ks, a proxy for the passage of time) varied dramatically among
studies for which sequence data were available for the sampled
enzymes, with a majority of studies focused on deeply diver-
gent enzymes. Studies were assigned to one of two divergence
classes based on whether Ks between enzyme-coding genes was
less than or greater than 0.25 synonymous nucleotide substitutions
per synonymous site (“low” and “high” divergence, respectively;
Table 1). By this criterion, 11 estimated correlations from seven
studies were classified as “low divergence” and 28 from 18 studies
as “high divergence.” The second model included the average dif-
ference in organism optimal environmental temperature as a fixed
effect for studies for which ecological data were available for
sampled taxa: one might expect that stability and activity might
be more strongly associated for studies investigating enzymes
derived from more divergent thermal environments.
The effect of sequence divergence class on the stability–
activity relationship was very highly significant (F[1,21.88] = 13.73;
P = 0.001; N = 38), with studies of more divergent enzymes more
likely to exhibit a negative relationship between stability and ac-
tivity (Fig. 2). This model fit the data better than a null model with
only study as random effect, based on lower AICc and BIC scores
(AICc = 8.36, BIC = 7.23). By contrast, there was no effect
of the average difference in optimal environmental temperature
(F[1,17.6] = 1.07; P = 0.32; N = 37) on the stability–activity rela-
tionship. That is, the relationship did not depend on the amount of
ecological divergence among taxa, nor was the above association
with sequence divergence a product of more divergent enzymes
being derived from organisms from more divergent habitats.

than (“Low”) or greater than (“High”) 0.25 substitutions per syn-
onymous nucleotide site, respectively.
This result potentially has important implications for our
understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship be-
tween stability and activity for natural enzymes. For a trade-off
mechanism mediated by the pleiotropic effects of changes in en-
zyme flexibility on both stability and function, a negative re-
lationship is expected to be intrinsic to the process of enzyme
functional divergence itself and therefore independent of the level
of sequence divergence. By contrast, the observed effect of se-
quence divergence suggests that, for some enzymes, a negative
relationship between stability and activity may only develop over
time as enzymes diverge, rather than by a trade-off mechanism.
What might be responsible for this pattern? One possibility is
that this may instead be due to the accumulation of conditionally
deleterious mutations that are not exposed to selection in the na-
tive environment but which are revealed during activity assays at
lower temperature.
Do we see any evidence for the emergence of a negative
relationship between stability and activity as natural enzymes
diverge? Although no single dataset in this analysis can address
this question, there are six different lactate dehydrogenase studies
spanning a wide range of mean sequence divergence (Ks = 0.009–
0.375 synonymous nucleotide substitutions/synonymous site) for
which data are available for both Km[pyruvate] and enzyme stability
(Table 1; Z¨ulli et al. 1991; Voorter et al. 1993; Holland et al.
1997; Fields and Somero 1997; Fields and Somero 1998; Sharpe
et al. 2001). Consistent with mutation accumulation as opposed
to a direct trade-off mechanism, the estimated correlations are
positive for samples with lower mean sequence divergence and
become more negative with increasing divergence (r = –0.76 for
the relationship between rstudy and Ks; F[1,4] = 5.52, P = 0.078).
Engineered enzymes frequently do not exhibit
a stability-activity trade-off
Another possible source of insight on this issue may be found
in the biotechnology literature. Twenty-three directed evolution
studies were identified for which mutant enzymes engineered by
the random mutagenesis of a wild-type template were (1) screened
for an increase in either stability and/or activity compared with the
wild type and (2) subsequently assessed for a trade-off in the other
trait (Table 2). The majority of these studies involved a single gen-
eration of error-prone PCR under conditions for which only 1–2
amino acid changes were expected per mutant. Though designed
as a high-throughput strategy for identifying changes in enzyme
properties of potential commercial interest, the approach informs
our understanding of the evolutionary process itself by providing
samples of functionally divergent enzymes that are nearly iden-
tical in sequence. Mutants with enhanced performance for the
screened trait were generally rare, in accord with the expecta-
tion that most amino acid substitutions are deleterious. However,
for many studies, among those mutants with an evolved increase
in either thermal stability or activity, there was often no cost in
performance for the other trait (Table 2). Therefore, at microevo-
lutionary scales of divergence, a direct trade-off between stability
and activity frequently does not exist for either laboratory-evolved
or natural enzymes.
The frequent absence of a stability-activity trade-off during
microevolutionary divergence is not restricted to an in vitro di-
rected evolution approach. Often, enzyme thermostability also
significantly increases without an activity cost during the in vivo
experimental evolution of laboratory populations of a geneti-
cally modified thermophile that has been rendered temperature
sensitive by the replacement of a native enzyme with a less
stable ortholog (Akanuma et al. 1998; Tamakoshi et al. 2001;
Cou˜nago et al. 2006; Nakamura et al. 2008). For example, se-
lection for increased stability of the leucine biosynthetic enzyme
3-isopropylmate dehydrogenase in a leucine-auxotrophic strain of
the thermophilic host bacterium Thermus thermophilus resulted
in a more stable enzyme without a cost in activity, irrespective
of whether the less stable progenitor enzyme was derived from
the mesophilic bacterium Bacillus subtilis (Akanuma et al. 1998)
or from yeast (Tamakoshi et al. 2001). Similarly, following the
replacement of adenylate kinase from Geobacillus stearother-
mophilus with that of B. subtilis, a series of more stable but not
necessarily less active enzyme variants evolved during the course
of 1500 G. stearothermophilus generations under increasing tem-
perature (Cou˜nago et al. 2006). Notably, structural analysis of one

BRIEF COMMUNICATION
mutant for which there was a decrease in activity at lower temper-
atures (and which differed from the B. subtilis enzyme by only a
single amino acid) revealed the source of enhanced stability to be
new ionic interactions that reduce enzyme flexibility (Cou˜nago
et al. 2008), precisely the thermodynamic mechanism for which
a trade-off is expected.
Concluding remarks
Though the existence of a stability-activity trade-off is often as-
serted for natural enzymes, the evolution of stability, and activity
may clearly be uncoupled during enzyme divergence. The present
study emphasizes that the general importance of the trade-off
remains to be established. This is, in part, because comparative
enzymological data that address this issue are limited. Moreover,
it is also due to the possibility that, for datasets focused on highly
divergent enzymes, the observed negative relationship between
stability and activity that is predicted by a trade-off mechanism
may have originated by an alternative process. To distinguish a
direct stability-activity trade-off from an alternative mechanism,
I recommend that future investigations of this issue focus on sam-
ples of recently divergent enzymes (for example between recently
divergent populations or species). This would avoid the possible
indirect effects of long-term divergence in different thermal envi-
ronments on enzyme stability and function (Fig. 2) and thereby
facilitate the inference of the actual mechanism underlying the
stability–activity relationship during the process of ecological di-
versification.
