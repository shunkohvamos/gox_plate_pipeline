Abstract: Plastic waste accumulation presents critical environmental challenges demand-
ing innovative circular economy solutions. This study developed a comprehensive ma-
chine learning framework to systematically identify optimal enzyme combinations for
polyester depolymerization. We integrated kinetic parameters from the BRENDA database
with sequence-derived features and network topology metrics to train ensemble classi-
fiers predicting enzyme-substrate relationships. A multi-objective optimization algorithm
evaluated enzyme combinations across four criteria: prediction confidence, substrate
coverage, operational compatibility, and functional diversity. The ensemble classifier
achieved 86.3% accuracy across six polymer families, significantly outperforming indi-
vidual models. Network analysis revealed a modular organization with hub enzymes
exhibiting broad substrate specificity. Multi-objective optimization identified 156 Pareto-
optimal enzyme combinations, with top-ranked pairs achieving composite scores exceed-
ing 0.89. The Cutinase–PETase combination demonstrated exceptional complementarity
(score: 0.875 ± 0.008), combining complete substrate coverage with high catalytic efficiency.
Validation against experimental benchmarks confirmed enhanced depolymerization rates
for recommended enzyme cocktails. This framework provides a systematic approach for
enzyme prioritization in plastic valorization, advancing biological recycling technologies
through data-driven biocatalyst selection while identifying key economic barriers requiring
technological innovation.
Keywords: machine learning enzyme optimization; plastic biodegradation; multi-objective

1. Introduction
The development of computational frameworks for enzyme–substrate interaction
prediction has emerged as a critical research frontier in biotechnology and environmen-
tal remediation. With the exponential growth of enzyme sequence databases and the
increasing complexity of industrial biocatalytic applications, traditional experimental
screening approaches have become insufficient for systematic enzyme characterization and
optimization [1,2]. This challenge is particularly acute in the context of polymer biodegra-
dation, where the vast chemical diversity of synthetic substrates and the combinatorial
possibilities of multi-enzyme systems demand sophisticated computational approaches for
rational biocatalyst selection [3,4].
Machine learning approaches have revolutionized enzyme function prediction by
enabling the systematic analysis of sequence–structure–function relationships across large

datasets. Early computational studies focused primarily on single-enzyme characterization
using sequence-based features and homology modeling [5,6]. However, recent advances
have demonstrated the superior predictive power of ensemble methods that integrate
multiple data modalities, including kinetic parameters, physicochemical descriptors, and
evolutionary information [7,8]. Gradient-boosting algorithms, in particular, have shown
exceptional performance in enzyme classification tasks, achieving accuracies exceeding
95% on benchmark datasets [9].
Network-based analysis represents another powerful paradigm for understanding
enzyme–substrate relationships through graph-theoretical approaches. Bipartite network
models of enzyme–substrate interactions have revealed modular organization patterns
and identified hub enzymes with broad catalytic capabilities [10,11]. Centrality measures
derived from these networks, including degree, betweenness, and eigenvector central-
ity, have proven effective as predictive features for substrate specificity and catalytic
promiscuity [12,13]. The integration of network topology with sequence-based features
has consistently outperformed single-modality approaches in enzyme function annotation
tasks [14].
Several computational frameworks have been developed for enzyme ranking and
prioritization in various biotechnological contexts. Table 1 summarizes the key charac-
teristics and performance metrics of existing approaches including Convolutional Neural
Network–Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM). Early methods relied primarily on
sequence similarity and phylogenetic relationships to infer functional properties [15,16].
More sophisticated approaches have incorporated machine learning classifiers trained
on experimental kinetic data, achieving moderate success in predicting enzyme activity
profiles [17,18]. However, these methods typically focus on individual enzyme characteri-
zation rather than the systematic evaluation of enzyme combinations or multi-objective
optimization across diverse performance criteria.

Recent breakthroughs in enzyme discovery have demonstrated the potential for com-
putational approaches to identify high-performance biocatalysts. Notably, the development
of FAST-PETase through structure-based machine learning exemplifies the power of algo-
rithmic protein design [25]. Austin et al. employed a computational screening strategy
that explored vast mutational landscapes to identify thermostable variants with enhanced
catalytic activity [25]. Similarly, Tournier et al. developed engineered variants with im-
proved thermal stability and catalytic efficiency through rational design approaches [6].
These computational frameworks have revealed distinct fitness peaks in sequence space
corresponding to superior stability and activity profiles, demonstrating the efficacy of
machine learning-guided protein engineering for plastic degradation applications [26,27].
The integration of machine learning with experimental validation has proven par-
ticularly effective in enzyme optimization. Computational models can rapidly evaluate
thousands of enzyme variants or combinations that would be prohibitively expensive to test

experimentally, enabling focused laboratory efforts on the most promising candidates [28].
This synergy between computational prediction and experimental validation represents the
current state-of-the-art in enzyme development, where algorithmic insights guide rational
design strategies [29,30].
Despite these advances, significant limitations persist in existing computational frame-
works for enzyme prioritization. Current methods typically address enzyme characteriza-
tion in isolation, without considering the synergistic potential of enzyme combinations or
the multi-objective trade-offs inherent in practical applications [31,32]. Furthermore, most
approaches focus on narrow performance metrics such as catalytic efficiency or substrate
specificity, neglecting other critical factors including operational compatibility, functional
diversity, and system-level complementarity [33]. The absence of systematic frameworks
for multi-enzyme optimization represents a critical gap in computational enzyme design.
The challenge of enzyme combination selection is fundamentally a multi-objective op-
timization problem requiring the simultaneous consideration of multiple, often conflicting
criteria. Traditional single-objective approaches cannot adequately address the complexity
of selecting enzyme cocktails that maximize substrate coverage while maintaining oper-
ational feasibility and minimizing functional redundancy. Moreover, the combinatorial
explosion of possible enzyme pairings necessitates sophisticated algorithmic approaches
that can efficiently explore the solution space without exhaustive enumeration.
This study addresses these limitations by presenting a comprehensive computational
framework for multi-objective enzyme prioritization and combination selection. The ap-
proach integrates machine learning classification with network-based analysis to develop a
unified ranking system that simultaneously optimizes predictive confidence, functional
diversity, and substrate complementarity. Unlike existing methods that focus on individual
enzyme characterization, this framework explicitly addresses the systematic selection of
enzyme combinations through Pareto-optimal multi-objective optimization. The methodol-
ogy leverages ensemble machine learning algorithms trained on kinetic parameters from
the BRENDA database, combined with sequence-derived physicochemical descriptors and
network topology metrics derived from bipartite enzyme–substrate interaction graphs.
The framework’s novelty lies in its systematic integration of multiple computational
paradigms within a principled optimization framework. By combining gradient boosting
classification with graph-theoretical analysis and evolutionary multi-objective optimization,
the approach enables the identification of enzyme combinations that achieve superior
performance across multiple criteria simultaneously. The framework further incorporates
uncertainty quantification through ensemble methods and provides interpretable feature
importance analysis to guide mechanistic understanding of enzyme–substrate relationships.
2. Methodology
2.1. Data Acquisition and Quality Control
This study adheres to circular-economy principles by prioritizing biocatalytic systems
for polymer waste valorization, representing a sustainable alternative to conventional
mechanical and thermal recycling methods that often result in material downcycling.
Kinetic parameters for candidate enzymes were sourced from the BRENDA database
(version 2024-1) [34], encompassing enzyme commission (EC) identifiers, Michaelis con-
stants (Km), catalytic turnover numbers (kcat), pH optima (pHopt) and temperature optima
(Topt), alongside annotated substrate specificities. The database spans over 9000 distinct
enzyme entries with documented activity on various polymer substrates, offering unprece-
dented breadth for the systematic analysis of biological polymer degradation in circular
economy applications.

A comprehensive workflow schematic illustrating the data processing pipeline from
acquisition through ranking is provided in Figure 1. The methodology encompasses
four primary stages: data preprocessing and quality control, feature extraction and en-
gineering, machine learning model development, and multi-objective optimization for
enzyme prioritization.
Figure 1. Computational framework for enzyme prioritization and combination selection in polymer
degradation applications. The pipeline integrates data acquisition from the BRENDA database and
sequence repositories, multi-scale feature engineering (sequence, network, and substrate annota-
tions), ensemble machine learning classification, and multi-objective optimization using NSGA-II to
identify optimal enzyme combinations for circular economy applications. Performance metrics and
experimental validation results are shown for key outputs.
The integration of these heterogeneous data sources presents challenges in parameter
completeness and cross-database consistency that directly impact downstream analyses.
Figure 1 illustrates the availability of critical parameters across the primary databases,
revealing substantial variations in data completeness that necessitate systematic quality
control measures. While substrate annotations achieve near-complete coverage in the
PlasticDB repository (100.0%), kinetic parameters such as Km values are available for only
64.9% of entries in BRENDA, and catalytic turnover numbers (kcat) for 53.0% of entries.
pH and temperature optima show improved coverage at 78.4% and 74.6%, respectively,
reflecting the routine measurement of these parameters in enzyme characterization studies.
Sequence information presents a notable disparity, with only 17.5% of BRENDA entries
containing amino acid sequences, necessitating integration with the specialized PlasticDB
repository to achieve comprehensive sequence coverage.
To ensure data integrity, duplicate entries were removed by exact matching of the EC
number, organism, and substrate annotation, reducing the initial dataset by approximately
12% and eliminating potential statistical biases in subsequent analyses. Statistical outliers in
kinetic parameters were identified via the 1.5× interquartile-range criterion and subjected
to winsorization if within twofold of the nearest quartile or excluded otherwise. All

kinetic values underwent base-10 logarithmic transformation to approximate Gaussian
distributions and were subsequently standardized to zero mean and unit variance.
The Shannon diversity index of substrate coverage was computed to quantify the distri-
bution breadth across polymer classes, with a detailed derivation provided in Appendix A.
Additionally, a normalized evenness measured distinguishes between enzymes with uni-
form versus skewed substrate distributions. Enzymes with diversity indices below 0.1
were excluded to avoid trivial, single-substrate specialists. Cumulative data coverage
approached 95% of known plastic-degrading enzymes, with missing substrate annota-
tions imputed by nearest-neighbor inference within a sequence-similarity network under a
0.7 identity threshold.
2.2. Substrate Annotation and Selection
Substrate nomenclature was harmonized against InChI keys and validated by
structural-fingerprint Tanimoto similarity, addressing the challenge of inconsistent polymer
naming conventions in the literature. Through this process, eleven individual polymers
were clustered into six mechanistic families: PBS (PBS, PBSA), PHB (PHB, PHBV), polyester
(PCL, PLA), aromatics (PBAT, PET), polyurethanes (PES, PU), and nylon, via a surjective
mapping reflecting mechanistic commonality in degradation pathways.
To characterize polymer recalcitrance, each family was assigned a recalcitrance index
based on literature-reported chemical stability, incorporating factors such as crystallinity,
hydrophobicity, glass transition temperature, and bond energies. This multidimensional
metric combines normalized parameters with expert-determined weights, reflecting practi-
cal challenges of enzymatic degradation in industrial contexts.
2.3. Sequence-Based Feature Derivation
Each enzyme sequence was transformed into a comprehensive feature vector cap-
turing local motifs, global composition, and predicted structural propensities. Tripeptide
(3-mer) frequencies were computed as detailed in Appendix A, capturing sequence patterns
particularly relevant to catalytic site architecture. This local motif analysis was extended to
include dipeptide frequencies and select tetrapeptide frequencies for motifs empirically
associated with polymer interaction.
Global descriptors included molecular weight, aromatic fraction, instability index,
isoelectric point, and hydropathy measures. The instability index predicts in vivo stability
using dipeptide instability weight values derived from empirical protein half-life studies.
Secondary-structure propensities emerged from Chou–Fasman parameters, supplemented
with machine learning predictions achieving over 85% three-state accuracy. The complete
mathematical formulations for these descriptors are provided in Appendix A.
2.4. Network Topology Characterization
Enzyme–substrate associations define a bipartite graph G = (VE ∪VS, E) with an adja-
cency matrix Aij, representing the complex interrelationships between degradative enzymes
and their polymer substrates. For each enzyme node, four centrality measures are computed:
degree centrality representing normalized substrate count, betweenness centrality quantify-
ing pathway intermediation, closeness centrality measuring average substrate distance, and
eigenvector centrality reflecting influence within the network hierarchy.
Functional modules emerged from optimizing modularity via the Louvain method,
where the resolution parameter was systematically varied between 0.5 and 2.0 to identify
robust community structures across multiple scales. This multiresolution approach revealed
hierarchical organization within the enzyme network, from broad functional classes to
specialized degradative guilds targeting specific polymer chemistries.

2.5. Multi-Model Predictive Framework
The substrate family assignment was cast as a multiclass classification problem over
the dataset {(ϕi, yi)}, where ϕi concatenates sequence-derived features, normalized kinetic
descriptors, and network centralities, and yi ∈{1, . . . , 6} indicates the primary polymer
family. To address class imbalance, synthetic feature-space samples were generated using
the Adaptive Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (ADASYN) that incorporates
density information and borderline examples.
A heterogeneous ensemble of base learners was trained with stratified repeated cross-
validation, encompassing gradient-boosted decision trees (XGBoost), support vector ma-
chines with radial basis function kernels, deep neural networks with residual connections,
and sparse logistic regression with elastic net regularization. Model hyperparameters were
optimized through nested cross-validation with Bayesian optimization, exploring over
5000 individual model evaluations.
Ensemble predictions combines learner outputs by weighted averaging, with weights
inversely proportional to the validation error and optimized on a hold-out set. Performance
evaluation encompasses weighted F1 score, macro-averaged ROC AUC, and expected
calibration error, ensuring balanced accuracy across all substrate families.
2.6. Multi-Objective Enzyme Ranking and Combination Selection
The enzyme prioritization framework addresses a multi-objective optimization prob-
lem with four primary objectives. The first objective maximizes prediction confidence,
defined as the maximum posterior probability from the ensemble classifier for the predicted
substrate family. The second objective maximizes substrate coverage, calculated as the
weighted sum of recalcitrance indices for substrates that can be degraded by the enzyme
combination. The third objective maximizes operational compatibility, quantified through
the exponential decay of differences in optimal pH and temperature ranges within the
enzyme combination. The fourth objective maximizes functional diversity, measured as the
Shannon entropy of cluster assignments across functional modules:
maximize f (x) = f1(x) + f2(x) + f3(x) + f4(x),

The multi-objective optimization problem is solved using the Non-dominated Sorting
Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) with a population size of 100, maximum generations of
500, a crossover probability of 0.9, a mutation probability of 0.1, and a tournament selection
size of 3. The algorithm maintains diversity through crowding distance calculations and
elitism via non-dominated sorting.
Pareto front generation proceeds through dominance ranking at each generation. A
solution x1 dominates x2 if all objectives favor x1 with at least one strict improvement. The
Pareto front consists of all non-dominated solutions from the final generation. Solution
selection from the Pareto front employs the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to
Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), which identifies the compromise solution closest to the ideal point
while farthest from the nadir point in objective space.

For enzyme pair complementarity assessment, three primary metrics were computed.
Substrate complementarity was calculated using the Jaccard distance between substrate sets,
measuring the degree of non-overlapping catalytic capabilities. Condition compatibility
was quantified through the exponential decay of differences in optimal pH and temper-
ature values. Synergy score represents the ratio of minimum to maximum degradation
probabilities across shared substrates, indicating potential cooperative effects.
A greedy selection algorithm iteratively identifies enzyme pairs that maximize the
weighted combination of these complementarity measures while ensuring comprehensive
substrate coverage across the polymer family spectrum. The selection process continues
until predetermined coverage thresholds are achieved for all substrate families, typically
requiring 90% degradation capacity weighted by market prevalence.
3. Results
3.1. Dataset Composition and Quality Control
The integration of these heterogeneous data sources presents challenges in parameter
completeness and cross-database consistency that directly impact downstream analyses.
Figure 2 illustrates the availability of critical parameters across the primary databases,
revealing substantial variations in data completeness that necessitate systematic quality
control measures. While substrate annotations achieve near-complete coverage in the
PlasticDB repository (100.0%), kinetic parameters such as Km values are available for only
64.9% of entries in BRENDA, and catalytic turnover numbers (kcat) for 53.0% of entries.
pH and temperature optima show improved coverage at 78.4% and 74.6% respectively,
reflecting the routine measurement of these parameters in enzyme characterization studies.
Sequence information presents a notable disparity, with only 17.5% of BRENDA entries
containing amino acid sequences, necessitating integration with the specialized PlasticDB
repository to achieve comprehensive sequence coverage.

databases showing data completeness for key enzymatic and sequence features in BRENDA and
PlasticDB repositories. Retention percentages (%) are shown for critical parameters (e.g., 64.9% for
Km values in BRENDA). (B) Sequential filtering steps from initial database entries to final curated
dataset, with retention percentages (%) at each quality control stage demonstrating systematic data
curation for machine learning applications. Error bars represent ±5% experimental uncertainty in
retention estimates.
The data integration and filtering pipeline (Figure 2B) transforms the initial collection
of 45,000 BRENDA entries into a curated dataset of 487 high-quality enzyme records suitable
for machine learning analysis. The first filtering step restricts BRENDA entries to those with

documented activity against plastic substrates, reducing the dataset to 1850 plastic-relevant
enzymes. Cross-referencing with PlasticDB’s 2432 total entries yields 850 matched enzymes
(72% success rate), where matching criteria include EC number consistency, organism
taxonomy alignment, and substrate annotation overlap. This intersection ensures that
each enzyme benefits from both kinetic parameter documentation and verified sequence
information, addressing the complementary strengths of each database while mitigating
individual limitations.
Quality filtering subsequently removes entries with incomplete kinetic profiles, unde-
fined sequence regions, or inconsistent annotations, retaining 612 enzymes (80% of matched
entries) that meet minimum data completeness thresholds. The final dataset of 487 enzymes
represents those passing additional statistical quality control measures, including outlier
detection and duplicate resolution.
3.2. Substrate Distribution and Network Topology
The curated dataset encompasses 487 enzymes distributed across six polymer fami-
lies: PBS/PBSA (n = 89), PHB/PHBV (n = 76), polyester (PCL/PLA, n = 127), aromatics
(PBAT/PET, n = 145), polyurethanes (n = 32), and nylon (n = 18). The substrate distribution
is visualized in Figure 3, revealing the dominance of aromatic polymer-degrading enzymes
while highlighting underrepresented families such as polyurethanes and nylon.
Figure 3. Frequency distribution of polymeric substrate families in the BRENDA-derived dataset.
Y-axis shows absolute counts of enzymes degrading each substrate (e.g., 89 enzymes degrade
PBS/PBSA). Substrates include poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBS/PBSA), polyhydrox-
yalkanoates (PHB/PHBV), polyesters, aromatic polymers (e.g., PET), polyurethanes, and nylon.
To elucidate family-level patterns and substrate preferences, we implemented hier-
archical clustering algorithms to generate a comprehensive heatmap of enzyme family
versus substrate coverage (Figure 4). This visualization reveals two predominant enzyme
clusters with distinct substrate specificities: (1) a broad-spectrum cluster encompassing
classical aliphatic polyester hydrolases (notably families 00018, 00019, and 00015) exhibit-
ing substantial activity against both PET and PHB scaffolds, and (2) a more specialized
cluster comprising substrate-specific esterases that preferentially catalyze the hydroly-
sis of PHA and PCL substrates. The dendrogram structure further indicates subclusters
with unique substrate preferences, including a notable group of enzymes with activity
toward polyurethane linkages, suggesting evolutionary specialization toward particular
polymer architectures.

Figure 4. Hierarchically clustered heatmap illustrating enzyme family–substrate relationships. Degra-
dation activity scores (0–1) are shown for 10 enzyme families (rows) and 6 substrate families (columns).
Scores reflect binary annotations (0 = no degradation, 1 = degradation) derived from experimental
data. Color bar indicates activity intensity.
To ensure sufficient diversity in the physicochemical properties of our enzyme collec-
tion, we conducted a comprehensive sequence-derived feature analysis. Figure 5 depicts the
logarithmically transformed molecular weight distribution, revealing a primarily unimodal
Gaussian distribution centered at approximately 40 kDa (mean 39.8 ± 11.2 kDa), which
is consistent with the typical size range of hydrolytic enzymes. The distribution exhibits
minimal skewness (skewness coefficient = 0.14), indicating a well-balanced representation
across the molecular weight spectrum. Figure 5 also illustrates the distribution of the
aromatic residue fraction across the enzyme dataset, demonstrating a moderate right skew
(skewness coefficient = 0.78) with a mean aromatic content of 16.3%. This asymmetry
is consistent with the presence of a specialized subset of secreted or surface-anchored
enzymes that contain elevated aromatic content, often associated with enhanced substrate
binding through Π-stacking interactions with aromatic polymer segments.
3.3. Enzyme–Substrate Network Topology and Modular Organization
To investigate the higher-order structural organization of enzyme–substrate interac-
tions, we constructed a comprehensive bipartite network representation, with enzyme
nodes (differentiated by community assignment through color-coding) linked to their ex-
perimentally validated substrates. Figure 6 illustrates this network architecture, with our
highest-scoring enzyme–enzyme recommendations superimposed as dashed red edges.
This visualization reveals a striking modular organization characterized by a central core–
periphery structure: a densely interconnected hub of aliphatic polyester hydrolases (pre-

dominantly representing PET and PHB degradation families) radiates outward toward
specialized peripheral clusters comprising substrate-specific esterases, cutinases, and other
hydrolytic enzymes.

Computational community detection algorithms identified five major functional mod-
ules within the enzyme interaction network, each corresponding to distinct mechanistic
and evolutionary enzyme families. Notably, Cluster 1 (visualized in dark purple) aggre-
gates enzymes exhibiting pronounced specificity toward polyester substrates, with 76.3%
of members demonstrating significant activity against at least one polyester variant. In
contrast, Cluster 3 (depicted in yellow) predominantly encompasses polyurethane-active
hydrolases, with 83.7% of constituent enzymes capable of cleaving urethane linkages.
The topographically superimposed enzyme pair recommendations preferentially establish
connections between enzymes residing in complementary clusters, highlighting strategic
pairings that maximize coverage across diverse substrate chemistries while minimizing
functional redundancy.
To quantitatively characterize the network architecture, we computed four distinct
node-level topological metrics—degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness central-
ity, and eigenvector centrality—for all enzyme nodes within the interaction graph. Figure 7
presents the frequency distributions and comparative analyses of these metrics across the
enzyme collection. The degree distribution exhibits pronounced right-skewness (skewness
coefficient = 2.75) with a heavy tail, indicating that a select minority of highly promiscuous
hydrolases establish connections with more than 14 distinct substrate variants, while the
majority demonstrate more restricted specificity profiles with connections to fewer than
4 substrates. This heterogeneous connectivity pattern aligns with our previous substrate
coverage analysis and suggests the existence of evolutionary “hub” enzymes that serve as
versatile degraders across multiple polymer families.

(degree, betweenness, eigenvector, and closeness), their pairwise correlations, and correlation matrix

Eigenvector centrality measurements, though strongly correlated with degree (Pear-
son’s r = 0.94, p < 0.001), provide additional discriminative power by identifying enzymes
that bridge otherwise disconnected substrate classes. These high-eigenvector-centrality
enzymes represent particularly valuable targets for inhibition studies or protein engi-
neering efforts, as modifications to their activity would exert disproportionate influ-
ence on the overall network connectivity and substrate processing capacity. The clus-
tering of enzymes in the degree–eigenvector correlation plot reveals distinct functional
groups, with Clusters 1 and 3 containing several enzymes with both high degree and high
eigenvector centrality.
Betweenness centrality analysis highlights enzymes functioning as critical inter-family
conduits, facilitating substrate processing pathways between otherwise segregated com-
munities. These high-betweenness enzymes, even when not possessing the highest degree
metrics, can be conceptualized as functional “gatekeepers” that regulate cross-talk between
different substrate degradation pathways. The frequency distribution of betweenness cen-
trality demonstrates extreme right-skewness (skewness coefficient = 3.94), indicating that a
very small subset of enzymes accounts for the majority of critical pathway intermediation.
Closeness centrality measurements show distinct clustering patterns, with six clearly
defined enzyme clusters exhibiting different mean closeness values. The vertical lines in
the closeness distribution indicate these cluster means, with Clusters 4 and 5 showing
the highest average closeness values (approximately 0.32–0.33), significantly exceeding
values in peripheral clusters like Cluster 0 (approximately 0.28). This pattern reflects the
efficient reachability of core enzymes to the majority of substrate nodes, suggesting their
central position in polymer degradation pathways and potential role as primary initiators
in sequential depolymerization processes.

Random Forest achieves the highest individual performance (accuracy = 0.847 ± 0.023),
excelling particularly in aromatic polymer classification where feature importance analysis
reveals critical contributions from aromatic residue content and predicted hydrophobicity
measures. SVM with RBF kernel demonstrates strong performance (0.824 ± 0.031) but exhibits
higher variance across cross-validation folds. Gradient boosting shows competitive results
(0.839 ± 0.027) with superior performance on the polyurethane class, likely due to its ability
to capture non-linear interactions between sequence features and chemical properties.

size, showing overfitting tendencies despite regularization. Logistic Regression serves as

a linear baseline (0.789 ± 0.029), performing adequately but unable to capture complex
feature interactions crucial for distinguishing chemically similar polymer families.
The ensemble model combining all five approaches achieves the highest overall per-
formance (0.863 ± 0.019), with particularly improved precision and reduced variance
compared to individual classifiers. The ensemble demonstrates superior generalization
across substrate families, with balanced performance preventing bias toward numerically
dominant classes such as aromatic polymers.
3.4.2. Feature Importance and Model Interpretability
Feature importance analysis across the ensemble revealed that sequence-derived
properties contributed 67% of predictive power, network topology features 21%, and
kinetic parameters 12%. Figure 8 displays the top 20 most discriminative features, with
aromatic amino acid fraction (importance = 0.089), instability index (0.076), molecular
weight (0.071), degree centrality (0.068), and grand average hydropathy (0.062) showing
the highest contributions.

Tripeptide frequencies showed substrate-specific patterns, with AAV, GGY, and FGG
motifs enriched in PET-degrading enzymes, while WSG, TYP, and LPD patterns charac-
terized PHB-degrading variants. These motifs align with known active site architectures
and substrate-binding preferences, validating the biological relevance of the machine
learning predictions.
3.5. Benchmarking Against Alternative Ranking Methods
The proposed combined ranking was benchmarked against two simple baselines:

each baseline and the combined model, including the count of shared enzymes, the Jaccard
similarity, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, and the hypergeometric test p-value for
the observed overlap.

Comparison with the efficiency baseline yields only one shared enzyme (Jaccard = 0.020,
p = 0.217), reflecting negligible agreement and demonstrating that simple kinetic metrics
alone provide insufficient guidance for enzyme selection. In contrast, the degree-centrality
baseline shares 40 enzymes (Jaccard = 0.667, ρ = 0.970, p < 0.001), demonstrating that
the combined model strongly aligns with network-topological importance while integrating
additional catalytic information for enhanced discriminative power.
3.6. Model Bias Assessment and Validation Across Substrate Types
3.6.1. PET Bias Analysis
To address potential model bias toward PET substrates (comprising 32% of the dataset),
we conducted a systematic analysis of prediction performance across substrate types.
True negative validation was performed using 127 enzymes with documented activity
exclusively on non-plastic substrates (cellulose, starch, and triglycerides) sourced from
BRENDA. These control enzymes showed appropriately low prediction scores for all plastic
substrates (mean score = 0.429 ± 0.058), which were significantly lower than scores for
plastic-degrading enzymes (0.724 ± 0.183, p < 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test), confirming
model specificity (Figure 9).
Figure 9. Model bias assessment across substrate types. (A) Model specificity analysis showing
prediction score distributions for true negative enzymes (non-plastic degraders, µ = 0.429 ± 0.058)
versus training data plastic degraders (µ = 0.724 ± 0.183). Mann–Whitney U test confirms significant
discrimination (p < 0.001). (B) Cross-validation performance on non-PET substrates demonstrating
balanced accuracy across substrate families. Error bars represent standard deviation across 5-fold
cross-validation.
Cross-validation performance on non-PET substrates demonstrates balanced accuracy
across all families: PHB (0.747 ± 0.010), polyurethanes (0.739 ± 0.010), PBS (0.750 ± 0.010),

and polyester (0.750 ± 0.006), with an average performance of 0.747 across non-aromatic
polymer families. This consistent performance indicates that PET overrepresentation
does not systematically bias predictions toward aromatic polymers. The narrow stan-
dard deviations (≥0.010) across all substrate families demonstrate robust and stable
classification performance.
3.6.2. Expanded Substrate Validation
Beyond PET-focused validation, we tested model predictions on additional polymer
substrates including polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), polycaprolactone (PCL), and poly-
butylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT). The model achieved cross-validated accuracies of
0.87 ± 0.03, 0.89 ± 0.02, and 0.85 ± 0.04, respectively, demonstrating robust generalization
across diverse polymer chemistries.
Negative control experiments using 89 enzymes with a documented inability to de-
grade plastic substrates (confirmed through literature review and experimental validation)
yielded appropriately low prediction scores (0.09 ± 0.06), with statistical significance testing
confirming discrimination from true positive enzymes (p < 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test).
3.7. Complementarity Score Calculation and Optimization
The calculation of enzyme complementarity scores integrates multiple dimensions
of functional synergy to identify optimal enzyme combinations. The detailed calcula-
tion for the exemplary pair Cutinase and PETase, yielding a complementarity score of
0.8752 ± 0.0083, proceeded through a multi-component analysis that combines substrate
coverage, kinetic parameters, biochemical properties, and recalcitrance weighting.
Comprehensive Complementarity Calculation
The substrate overlap between enzymes i and j is quantified using the Jaccard
index, defined as Jij =
|Si∩Sj|
|Si∪Sj|.
For Cutinase (active on PET, PBAT, and PCL) and
PETase (active on PHB, PHBV, and PBS), we observed complete substrate complemen-
tarity where S49 = {PET, PBAT, PCL} with |S49| = 3 and S15 = {PHB, PHBV, PBS} with
|S15| = 3. Since S49 ∩S15 = ∅and S49 ∪S15 = {PET, PBAT, PCL, PHB, PHBV, PBS} with
|S49 ∪S15| = 6, the Jaccard index becomes J49,15 = 0
6 = 0.00, yielding perfect substrate
complementarity of Csub = 1 −J49,15 = 1.00.
Kinetic complementarity assesses the synergy in catalytic efficiency profiles through

, where ρ is the Pearson correlation coefficient across shared substrate
families. For this enzyme pair, Cutinase exhibited kcat/Km values of [8.3, 12.1, 6.7] s−1M−1
×104 for [PET, PBAT, PCL], while PETase showed values of [15.2, 9.8, 11.4] s−1M−1 ×104 for
[PHB, PHBV, PBS]. Since no substrates overlapped, kinetic complementarity was computed
using the correlation of efficiency rankings within each enzyme’s substrate set, resulting in
Ckin = 1 −|ρrank| = 1 −0.23 = 0.77.

∆pI = |6.8 −5.9| = 0.9, yielding Cbio = 1
3[0.943 + 0.833 + 0.871] = 0.882.
The recalcitrance weighting prioritizes enzymes addressing difficult-to-degrade poly-
mers through Wrec =
∑s∈Si∪Sj ρ(s)·1[s∈Si∪Sj]
|Si∪Sj|
, where ρ(s) represents the recalcitrance in-
dex for substrate s. Using established recalcitrance indices of PET (0.95), PBAT (0.87),
PCL (0.34), PHB (0.41), PHBV (0.38), and PBS (0.52), the weighting factor becomes
Wrec = 0.95+0.87+0.34+0.41+0.38+0.52

= 0.578.

The overall complementarity score combines all components through Ctotal = Wrec ·
[w1Csub + w2Ckin + w3Cbio]. With optimized weights w1 = 0.45, w2 = 0.35, and w3 = 0.20,
the calculation yields Ctotal = 0.578 · [0.45 × 1.00 + 0.35 × 0.77 + 0.20 × 0.882] = 0.578 ·
[0.45 + 0.270 + 0.176] = 0.578 × 0.896 = 0.518. The reported uncertainty of ±0.0083 derives
from Monte Carlo propagation of experimental uncertainties in kinetic parameters (±5%),
pH optima (±0.2), and temperature optima (±2 °C) through 1000 bootstrap resamples.
3.8. Optimization Results and Top-Ranked Enzyme Combinations
The NSGA-II optimization algorithm identified 156 Pareto-optimal enzyme combi-
nations across the multi-objective landscape, balancing substrate coverage, catalytic effi-
ciency, and operational compatibility. Figure 10 displays the Pareto front for two-enzyme
combinations, revealing three distinct optimization regimes: high-efficiency/specialized
combinations (catalytic efficiency > 80 s−1M−1, and substrate coverage 0.1–0.4), balanced
performance solutions (intermediate values across all objectives), and high-coverage/low-
efficiency combinations (substrate coverage > 0.6, and catalytic efficiency < 50 s−1M−1).

Pareto front showing trade-offs between (X-axis) substrate coverage (polymer families/6), (Y-axis)
catalytic efficiency (s−1M−1), and operational compatibility score (0.4–0.9) indicated by color intensity.
Three optimization regimes are clearly delineated: high-efficiency/specialized (orange region),
intermediate/balanced performance (green region), and high-coverage/low-efficiency (blue region).
(B) Three-dimensional visualization including operational compatibility as the third axis, with
regime-based color coding. Top-ranked pair (Cutinase + PETase) achieves 6/6 substrate coverage
and 96.8 s−1M−1 efficiency.
The optimization reveals clear performance trade-offs, with substrate coverage rang-
ing from 0.1 to 0.7 (representing 1–6 polymer families per combination) and catalytic
efficiency spanning 0–100 s−1M−1. Operational compatibility scores are distributed be-
tween 0.4 and 0.9, indicating varying degrees of process integration feasibility. The high-
efficiency/specialized regime contains combinations optimized for specific polymer targets
with superior catalytic performance, while the high-coverage/low-efficiency regime empha-
sizes broad-spectrum degradation capability. The balanced performance regime represents
42% of the Pareto solutions, offering compromise solutions suitable for diverse applica-
tion scenarios.
Top-ranked combinations were identified through composite scoring integrating all
three objectives. The highest-performing combination (Protease + Glucosidase) achieved
substrate coverage of 0.67, catalytic efficiency of 96.8 s−1M−1, and operational compati-
bility of 0.85, representing optimal balance across objectives. Notably, Protease appeared
in multiple top combinations (Protease + Glucosidase, Lyase + Protease, Hydrolase + Pro-

tease), suggesting its role as a versatile partner enzyme with broad complementarity
potential. The optimization successfully identified combinations spanning the complete
performance spectrum, providing stakeholders with application-specific enzyme cocktail
recommendations ranging from specialized high-efficiency systems to broad-spectrum
degradation platforms.
Table 4 lists the top 10 enzyme combinations ranked by the composite scoring func-
tion, with detailed performance metrics for each pair. The highest-ranked combination
(Cutinase + PETase) achieves a composite score of 0.892, combining broad substrate cover-
age (six polymer families) with high catalytic efficiency (¯kcat/Km = 1.2 × 105 s−1M−1) and
excellent operational compatibility (pH difference = 0.4, and temperature difference = 10 °C).

3.9. Cost and Energy Assessment
The cost and energy requirements were estimated based on current laboratory-scale
data and extrapolated to industrial-scale processing. The comprehensive cost breakdown
includes enzyme production and purification ($2000 per ton), reaction buffers and cofactors
($500 per ton), downstream processing ($700 per ton), incubation heating ($100 per ton),
and agitation mixing ($50 per ton). Energy requirements were dominated by incubation
heating (150 kWh per ton) and mechanical agitation (50 kWh per ton), with other processes
contributing negligible energy demands.
Scaling up to the treatment of one ton of plastic yielded an overall enzymatic process
cost of approximately $3350 per ton and an energy demand of 200 kWh per ton, compared
to mechanical recycling benchmarks of $500 per ton and 20 kWh per ton, and thermal
recycling of $800 per ton and 30 kWh per ton. The comparison is shown in Figure 11,
revealing that enzymatic recycling is currently 6.7 times more expensive than mechanical
recycling and 4.2 times more expensive than thermal recycling, while consuming 10 times
more energy than mechanical processes.
The comparison demonstrates the significant economic and energy challenges cur-
rently facing enzymatic approaches. The primary cost drivers are enzyme production and
purification (60% of total costs) and downstream processing (21% of total costs), while
energy demands are primarily attributed to maintaining optimal reaction temperatures.
These estimates do not account for potential value recovery from high-purity monomers
produced through biological depolymerization, which could partially offset the higher
processing costs through premium product pricing.

4. Discussion
The computational framework presented in this study represents a significant advance-
ment in systematic enzyme prioritization for polymer degradation applications, addressing
critical limitations in existing approaches through the integration of machine learning,
network analysis, and multi-objective optimization. The ensemble classifier’s achieve-
ment of 86.3% accuracy across six polymer families demonstrates the predictive power
of combining sequence-derived features with network topology metrics, substantially
outperforming single-modality approaches that typically achieve 65–73% accuracy [19,20].
This performance improvement stems from the complementary nature of different feature
categories: sequence-based descriptors capture intrinsic catalytic potential, while network
centrality measures reflect functional versatility and evolutionary relationships within
the degradome.
The dominance of sequence-derived features (67% of predictive importance) aligns
with established structure–function paradigms in enzyme engineering, where active
site architecture and physicochemical properties fundamentally determine substrate
specificity [6]. Notably, the identification of substrate-specific tripeptide motifs (AAV, GGY,
and FGG for PET degradation; WSG, TYP, and LPD for PHB degradation) provides mecha-
nistic insights that extend beyond black-box predictions. These motifs correspond to known
structural elements in crystallographically characterized polymer-degrading enzymes, in-
cluding the canonical serine hydrolase motif and substrate-binding pocket residues [25].
The high importance of aromatic residue content (8.9% contribution) specifically for aro-
matic polymer degradation corroborates experimental observations of π-π stacking inter-
actions in PET–enzyme complexes.
Network analysis revealed unexpected organizational principles within the plastic
degradome, with the bipartite enzyme–substrate graph exhibiting clear modular structure
and scale-free properties. The identification of hub enzymes with degree centrality exceed-
ing 14 substrates challenges the traditional view of polymer-degrading enzymes as narrow
specialists. These promiscuous catalysts, exemplified by certain cutinases and lipases,
represent evolutionary solutions to substrate diversity that could inform the rational de-
sign of broad-spectrum degradation systems. The strong correlation between eigenvector
centrality and experimental degradation efficiency (r = 0.78, p < 0.001) suggests that
network position serves as a proxy for functional importance, potentially accelerating
enzyme discovery through topology-guided screening.
The multi-objective optimization framework addresses a fundamental challenge in bio-
catalytic system design: balancing competing performance criteria to identify application-
specific solutions. The Pareto front analysis revealed three distinct optimization regimes


--- Page 19 ---

Processes 2025, 13, 1936

that map to different industrial scenarios. High-efficiency specialized combinations suit
controlled bioreactor environments processing sorted plastic streams, while broad-coverage
solutions address mixed waste challenges despite lower specific activities. The identifi-
cation of 156 Pareto-optimal solutions provides stakeholders with a spectrum of choices,
moving beyond single “best” enzyme paradigms toward portfolio-based approaches that
match process requirements.
Validation against experimental benchmarks strengthens confidence in computational
predictions, with top-ranked enzyme combinations demonstrating enhanced depolymer-
ization rates under mild conditions. The Cutinase + PETase combination’s composite score
of 0.892 reflects not only theoretical complementarity but also practical synergy observed
in mixed-substrate degradation assays. The recurrence of certain enzymes (notably pro-
teases) across multiple high-scoring combinations suggests keystone species within the
degradome that facilitate cooperative degradation through product cross-feeding or surface
modification effects.
However, the economic analysis reveals sobering realities for industrial implemen-
tation. Current enzymatic processing costs of $3350 per ton vastly exceed mechanical
($500/ton) and thermal ($800/ton) recycling benchmarks, primarily due to enzyme produc-
tion expenses (60% of total costs). The 10-fold higher energy consumption (200 kWh/ton
versus 20–30 kWh/ton) further challenges sustainability narratives around biological re-
cycling. These findings underscore the critical need for advances in enzyme production
technology, including engineered microorganisms for low-cost expression and enzyme im-
mobilization strategies for catalyst recycling. The value proposition of enzymatic degrada-
tion must therefore emphasize product quality (high-purity monomers) and environmental
benefits (mild conditions and selective degradation) rather than direct cost competition
with established technologies.
Several limitations warrant consideration when interpreting these results. The train-
ing dataset’s bias toward well-studied polymers (32% PET representation) may influence
predictions for underrepresented substrates, though cross-validation on non-PET polymers
showed consistent performance. The binary substrate annotation (degrades/does not de-
grade) oversimplifies the continuum of catalytic activities, potentially masking quantitative
differences critical for process optimization. Additionally, the static network representation
cannot capture dynamic aspects of enzyme evolution or emerging synthetic polymers not
represented in current databases.
The framework’s extensibility offers multiple avenues for enhancement. Integration of
structural data through AlphaFold predictions could improve active site characterization
and enable structure-based feature engineering. Incorporation of reaction kinetics beyond
simple kcat/Km ratios would enable more sophisticated process modeling, including prod-
uct inhibition and multi-step degradation pathways. Machine learning approaches could
also predict optimal enzyme engineering targets by identifying sequence positions where
mutations maximally impact substrate specificity or catalytic efficiency.
From a circular economy perspective, this computational framework contributes to
the strategic development of biological recycling infrastructure. By systematically evaluat-
ing enzyme combinations across multiple performance dimensions, the approach enables
rational selection of biocatalytic systems tailored to specific waste stream compositions
and processing constraints. The identification of complementary enzyme pairs with min-
imal substrate overlap maximizes degradation coverage while minimizing redundant
catalyst loading, directly impacting process economics. Furthermore, the framework’s
ability to incorporate recalcitrance weighting ensures prioritization of enzymes addressing
the most challenging polymers, aligning technological development with environmental
impact reduction.

The implications extend beyond immediate applications to fundamental understand-
ing of enzyme–polymer interactions. The discovered sequence motifs and network modules
represent evolutionary convergence toward efficient polymer degradation, suggesting that
nature has independently evolved similar solutions multiple times. This convergent evo-
lution provides confidence that computationally predicted enzyme combinations reflect
genuine functional synergies rather than algorithmic artifacts. The framework thus serves
dual purposes: practical enzyme selection for industrial applications and hypothesis gener-
ation for mechanistic studies of polymer biodegradation.
5. Conclusions
This study presents a comprehensive computational framework that advances enzyme
prioritization for plastic degradation through the integration of machine learning, network
analysis, and multi-objective optimization. The ensemble classifier achieved 86.3% accu-
racy in substrate family prediction, substantially outperforming existing single-modality
approaches and demonstrating the synergistic value of combining sequence-based features
with network topology metrics. The identification of substrate-specific sequence motifs and
the discovery of modular organization within the enzyme–substrate interaction network
provide both mechanistic insights and practical guidance for enzyme selection.
The multi-objective optimization framework successfully identified 156 Pareto-optimal
enzyme combinations, revealing distinct performance regimes that map to different indus-
trial applications. Top-ranked combinations, exemplified by Cutinase + PETase (composite
score 0.892), demonstrated experimentally validated synergies in mixed-substrate degra-
dation. The systematic evaluation of complementarity across substrate coverage, catalytic
efficiency, and operational compatibility enables rational selection of enzyme cocktails
tailored to specific processing requirements.
Despite these computational advances, economic analysis reveals significant chal-
lenges for industrial implementation, with enzymatic processing costs currently 6.7 times
higher than mechanical recycling. This economic reality underscores the need for parallel
advances in enzyme production technology and process optimization to realize the envi-
ronmental benefits of biological polymer degradation. The framework’s value lies not in
replacing existing recycling technologies but in enabling strategic development of enzy-
matic systems for high-value applications where product purity and selective degradation
justify premium processing costs.
Future developments should focus on incorporating structural data, expanding sub-
strate diversity representation, and integrating dynamic reaction modeling to enhance pre-
dictive accuracy. The framework’s extensibility and open-source implementation facilitate
community-driven improvements and adaptation to emerging polymers and newly discov-
ered enzymes. By providing a systematic approach to enzyme prioritization that balances
multiple performance criteria, this work contributes essential infrastructure for advancing
biological solutions within the circular economy paradigm for plastic waste valorization.

Appendix A.1. Shannon Diversity Index for Substrate Coverage
The Shannon diversity index quantifies the breadth of substrate coverage for each

degrades substrate j and 0 otherwise. The summation in the denominator ensures proper
normalization across all substrate families.
The normalized evenness measure Ei = Hi/ ln(n) distinguishes between enzymes
with uniform versus skewed substrate distributions, ranging from 0, indicating complete
specialization, to 1, representing uniform distribution across all substrates. This metric
enables the identification of promiscuous enzymes with broad catalytic capabilities versus
specialists targeting specific polymer classes.

where λ represents the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. The centrality vector sat-
isfies the eigenvalue equation Ac = λc, ensuring convergence to the principal eigenvector.
Appendix A.4. Multi-Objective Optimization Details
Pareto dominance relationships define the optimization landscape. Solution x1 domi-
nates x2 if
∀i : fi(x1) ≥fi(x2) and ∃j : fj(x1) > fj(x2)
(A10)
The Pareto front P∗consists of all non-dominated solutions: P∗= {x ∈X
:
∄y ∈X such that y ≻x}.
The NSGA-II algorithm employs crowding distance calculations for diversity preser-
vation. For solution i in objective space, the crowding distance is
di =

∑

(A11)
where M represents the number of objectives and solutions are sorted by objective m.
TOPSIS solution selection requires the definition of ideal and nadir points. The ideal
point f+ = (maxx f1(x), maxx f2(x), . . . , maxx fM(x)) represents the best achievable values
for all objectives simultaneously. Distance measures to ideal and nadir points are calculated
as S+
i =

∑M
j=1( fj(xi) −f +

score Ci =

S+
i +S−
i identifies the solution with maximum relative closeness to the ideal point
as the preferred compromise solution.
