ABSTRACT 
In the realm of enzyme engineering, dual enhancement of thermostability and 
activity remains a challenge. Herein, we employed a computer-aided approach 
integrating folding free energy calculations and evolutionary analysis to engineer 
Paecilomyces thermophila xylanase into a hyper-thermophilic enzyme for application 
in the paper and pulp industry. Through the computational rational design, XynM9 
with superior thermostability and enhanced activity was designed. Its optimal reaction 
temperature increases by 10 °C to 85 °C, its Tm increases by 10 °C to 93 °C, and its 
half-life increases 11-fold to 5.8 h. Additionally, its catalytic efficiency improves by 
57% to 3926 s-1 mM-1. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that XynM9 is 
stabilized by more hydrogen bonds and salt bridges than the wild-type xylanase. The 
mutant’s narrower catalytic cleft enhances the substrate binding affinity, thus 
improving the catalytic efficiency. In harsh conditions at 80 °C and pH 10, using 
XynM9 significantly reduced both hemicellulose and lignin, which makes it a good 
candidate for use in the paper and pulp process. Our study presents an accurate and 
efficient strategy for the dual enhancement of enzyme properties, guiding further 
improvement of computational tools for protein stabilization.

INTRODUCTION 
Lignocellulose is the most abundant renewable biomass in nature, composed mainly 
of 
cellulose 
(30-50%), 
hemicellulose 
(20-35%), 
and 
lignin 
(10-30%).1 
Endo-1,4-xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) play a crucial role in the paper and pulp industry by 
hydrolyzing the hemicellulose backbone.2 Xylanases from the glycoside hydrolase 
family 11 (GH11)  cleave the β -1,4-xylosidic bonds in xylan through a 
double-displacement mechanism.3 This process involves two conserved glutamate 
residues: one acts as a nucleophile/base, forming a covalent glycosyl-enzyme 
intermediate while the other functions as a general acid, donating a proton to facilitate 
glycosidic bond cleavage and stabilize the transition state during catalysis.  
Conventional bleaching processes in the paper industry often rely on large 
quantities of chlorine-based chemicals, which are environmentally hazardous.4 
Utilizing xylanases under alkaline (pH >10) and high-temperature (80~90 °C) 
conditions can effectively remove both hemicellulose and lignin, thereby increasing 
cellulose content.5 However, xylanase activity significantly diminishes under such 
harsh conditions, limiting their industrial application.6 XynA from Paecilomyces 
thermophila has a broad pH activity profile at 65 °C, making it a potential candidate 
for the paper industry.7  Introducing a disulfide bond in the C-terminal region 
(XynM2) has elevated its optimal reaction temperature to 75 °C.8 Nonetheless, its 
activity significantly dwindles above 80 °C, indicating the need for further 
improvement.

Directed evolution and rational design are commonly employed strategies for 
improving enzyme thermostability.9-11 Directed evolution typically involves too many 
inferior mutants, necessitating high-throughput screening capabilities.9, 12 Rational 
design demands an in-depth understanding of protein structure and function 
relationships at the atomic level.11 Modern computer-aided rational design 
significantly reduces the size of the mutant library and improves protein modification 
efficiency through techniques such as 3D-structure prediction,13 folding free energy 
change (ΔΔGfold) calculation,14 multiple sequence alignment (MSA),15 and molecular 
dynamics (MD) simulations16.  
Mutational effects are often quantified by folding free energy change (ΔΔGfold), 
with negative ΔΔGfold values indicating stabilizing mutations and positive ΔΔGfold 
values suggesting destabilizing mutations.14 Rosetta17, 18 and FoldX19 are effective in 
calculating ΔΔGfold after mutation.20 For instance, Zhao et al. employed Rosetta and 
FoldX to design a stabilizing mutation (D260V) of Proteinase K, resulting in a 12-fold 
increase of half-life at 69 °C.21 Chen et al. designed eight stabilizing mutations for 
Ketoreductase, with three predicted by FoldX and five by Rosetta.22  
Enzyme dynamics is critical for catalysis.23 Introducing stabilizing mutations could 
sometimes jeopardize enzyme dynamics, leading to decreased activity.24 Therefore, 
simultaneously improving both thermostability and activity is essential and 
challenging. Damborky’s work strongly suggested that energetic calculations should 
be complemented by phylogenetic analysis in protein-stabilization endeavors because 


--- Page 6 ---

more than half (53%) of evolution-based stabilizing mutations would be evaluated as 
destabilizing by energy calculations.25 During natural evolution, residues critical for 
enzyme folding and activity tend to be highly conserved.26 We believe that mutations 
with negative ΔΔGfold values and high conservation can improve both thermostability 
and activity.  
There are computational tools and strategies, such as HotSpot Wizard27 and 
FireProt,28 that incorporate both evolutionary-based and energy-based approaches to 
design single-point and multiple-point stabilizing mutants, respectively. These 
methods employ FoldX calculations before Rosetta_ddg calculations (or just FoldX) 
to predict the ΔΔGfold of mutants.28 FoldX offers faster calculation times, while 
Rosetta provides increased accuracy.19 We chose Rosetta Cartesian_ddg,17 Rosetta 
ddg_monomer,29 and FoldX18 to ensure good coverage of beneficial mutations 
because their predictions overlapped only in 12%, 15%, or 25%, respectively.30 
In our study, we combined energy-based and evolution-based analyses to design 
beneficial mutations of Paecilomyces thermophila xylanase (XynM2). Initially, we 
calculated the ΔΔGfold values for each possible mutation at all residue positions (a 
total of 3686) using three computational tools (Rosetta Cartesian_ddg, Rosetta 
ddg_monomer, and FoldX). We then applied multiple sequence alignment to analyze 
the conservation of these mutations. This process led to the design of eighteen 
candidate mutations, of which eight were confirmed as beneficial. Finally, we 
calculated ΔΔGfold for all 440 possible combinations to identify the best combination,

XynM9, which contains seven mutations. This hyper-thermophilic xylanase shows a 
10 °C increase in optimal reaction temperature to 85 °C, a 10 °C increase in Tm to 
93 °C and an 11-fold extension in half-life to 5.8 h. In addition, its catalytic efficiency 
improved by 57% compared to XynM2. Under harsh conditions of pH 10 and 80 °C, 
XynM9 significantly removed both lignin and hemicellulose, increasing cellulose 
content to 45.9%. This robust and active xylanase has great potential for application 
in the paper and pulp industry.  
RESULTS  
Computer-Aided Rational Design  
A reliable three-dimensional (3D) structure of an enzyme is essential for rational 
design of mutations.31 Among all resolved xylanase crystal structures, the xylanase 
from Thermomyces lanuginosus (PDB ID:1YNA) has the highest sequence identity 
(94.82%) with XynM2.32 We built a high-quality 3D model of XynM2 using 
AlphaFold2 (AF2),33 and checked its quality using the Ramachandran plot generated 
by PROCHECK.34 It shows that 91.8% of residues are located in the most favored 
regions, 8.2% in allowed regions, and no residues in disallowed regions (Figure S1). 
Generally, a high-quality model is expected to have over 90% residues in the most 
favored regions.35 Molprobity36 analysis shows that all C atoms are positioned within 
0.25Å deviation from their ideal values, all bond length deviations are less than 4σ 
from the ideal values, and no atom clashes are located in the selected regions (Table 
S1). These results confirm the high quality of the 3D model for rational design.

We calculated the ΔΔGfold values of all possible mutations at each residue position 
of XynM2 using three computational tools: Rosetta Cartesian_ddg, Rosetta

ddg_monomer, and FoldX. Each position in XynM2 was individually substituted with 
the other nineteen natural amino acids, creating three virtual mutant libraries 
containing 3686 mutations (Figure S2). Lower ΔΔGfold values indicate higher 
thermostability. However, higher thermostability does not mean higher activity. There 
are some mutations that result in higher Tm but lower relative activity than that of WT 
(Table S2).  To maintain both high activity and thermostability, we further analyzed 
the frequency of each mutation using the HotSpot Wizard (Figure S3).27 Finally, we 
selected eighteen candidate mutations based on both ΔΔGfold values and amino acid 
conservation (Figure 1A~B and Table 1): Using Rosetta Cartesian_ddg, we identified 
seven mutants (S19T, A57N, A125Q, T177V, T95D, D101G, E109Y) whose ΔΔGfold 
values are less than -2 kcal mol-1 and frequencies are above 10%. We also selected 
one more mutant (E31P) because its ΔΔGfold is -3.35 kcal mol-1 and the mutation 
frequency (3%) is higher than that of WT (2%). Three other mutants (G40S, D41G, 
Q151T) were selected because their mutation frequencies are the highest even though 
their ΔΔGfold is just below 0 kcal mol-1. Similarly, we selected six mutants (D63S, 
D101G, A125Q, D135H, D135N, T177V) based on the Rosetta ddg_monomer 
calculated ΔΔGfold values (<-2 kcal mol-1) and the sequence conservation 
(frequency >10%). We also chose seven mutants (D101G, D129I, Q151T, A162L, 
V166L, H170M, T177V) with the FoldX calculated ΔΔGfold values < -1.0 kcal mol-1) 
and their sequence conservation (frequencies above 10%). The positions of these 
mutations are depicted as spheres on the 3D structure of XynM2 (Figure 1C).

a Relative Activities were measured at 85 °C for an hour to assess the combined effect of activity and stability. 
b Specific Activities were measured at their optimal reaction temperature for 5 min.  
c Half-lives of XynM2 and its mutants were measured at 80 °C. 
We evaluated the thermostability of XynM2 and its mutants by measuring their 
melting temperatures (Tm). Out of the eighteen candidates, eight mutants (T177V, 
E31P, D41G, A57N, E109Y, S19T, G40S, and D135N) have increased Tm values 
(Figure 1D and Table S3). Notably, T177V and E31P show the most significant 
increases, reaching 85.6 °C and 85.2°C, respectively. In contrast, the other eleven 
candidates have lower Tm than XynM2 (Table S3). We also measured the half-lives 
(t1/2) of the eight mutants with higher Tm. All eight mutants (T177V, G40S, D41G, 
E31P, A57N, E109Y, D135N, and S19T) have higher t1/2 of 109, 84, 74, 74, 72, 58, 
55, and 44 minutes at 80 °C, respectively (Table 2). However, the increment 
amplitude of t1/2 is inconsistent with that of Tm. For instance, while the Tm of D135N 
is 0.2 °C, its t1/2 increases from 41 to 55 min. Conversely, the Tm of E31P is 2.4 °C, 


--- Page 13 ---

but its t1/2 also increases from 41 to 74 min (Table 2). In addition, six of the eight 
mutations (excluding S19T and D135N) show an optimal reaction temperature (Topt) 
of 80 °C, which is 5 °C higher than that of WT (Table 2).  
We assessed the relative activities of the eighteen candidates at 85 °C for 1 h to 
evaluate the combined effect on activity and stability. Among them, eleven mutants 
(S19T, E31P, G40S, D41G, A57N, E109Y, A125Q, D135N, Q151T, H170M, and 
T177V) show higher relative activities than that of WT. Particularly, A57N has the 
most significant increase (247% increased relative activity) (Table 2 and Figure 1D). 
Interestingly, three mutants (A125Q, Q151T, H170M) with decreased Tm have higher 
relative activities. We then measured the specific activity of the eight mutants with 
increased Tm. Among these mutants, three (S19T, A57N, and D135N) have higher 
specific activity, while the remaining five (T177V, E109Y, E31P, G40S, and D41G) 
have marginally lower specific activity (Table 2). 
Overall, eight mutants among the eighteen candidates simultaneously show 
increased Tm, t 
80 
1/2 , and relative activities. Rosetta Cartesian_ddg, Rosetta 
ddg_monomer, and FoldX have successfully predicted seven, two, and one beneficial 
mutation, respectively. Notably, T177V was predicted as a stable mutation by all 
three algorithms (Table 1).  
Designing the Beneficial Variant XynM9 by Rational Combination  
Combining individual stabilizing mutations can largely enhance enzyme stability.37 
We randomly recombined the eight mutations with higher Tm and relative activity and 


--- Page 14 ---

generated a library containing 247 mutants. Based on our previous findings, Rosetta 
Cartesian_ddg has the highest accuracy in predicting beneficial mutations. Therefore, 
we employed Rosetta Cartesian_ddg to calculate the ΔΔGfold values of all 
combinations. We observed that the minimal ΔΔGfold values for different 
combinations fit a parabolic curve (Figure 1F). Typically, combining more mutations 
results in lower minimal ΔΔGfold values. However, the lowest ΔΔGfold value belongs 
to the variant XynM9 containing seven mutations (S19T/E31P/G40S/D41G/ 
A57N/E109Y/T177V), whose ΔΔGfold value is -17 kcal mol-1. In comparison, the 
variant combining all eight mutations (XynM10) has the ΔΔGfold value of -16.43, 
which is 0.57 higher than XynM9 (Table S4). 
To verify whether the calculated ΔΔGfold value can guide the optimal combination, 
we measured Tm of variants with different combinations with their corresponding 
minimal ΔΔGfold values (Table S4). We observed that XynM9 has the highest Tm and 
the lowest ΔΔGfold. However, incorporating more mutations does not necessarily incur 
higher Tm as XynM10 has lower Tm than XynM9. The ΔΔGfold and ΔTm of variants 
show a strong negative correlation y=-0.58x-0.53 (R2=0.97) (Figure 1G), indicating 
that variants with lower calculated ΔΔGfold values are more likely to have higher 
thermostability (Tm). Among all the combined variants, XynM9 has the highest 
relative activity (11.5-fold as XynM2) and thermostability (Figure 1E and Table 3). 
Its Tm is 93.1°C (Table 3), which is 10.3 °C higher than that of XynM2. Its optimal 
reaction temperature is 85 °C (Figure 3D), which is 10 °C higher than XynM2. Its 


--- Page 15 ---

half-life at 85 °C is 350 min, which is 11-fold longer than XynM2. Additionally, its 
catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) is 3926s-1 mM-1 (Table 3), which is 57% higher than that 
of XynM2.

Structure Comparison between XynM9 and XynM2 by Molecular Dynamics 
Simulation 
To elucidate the mechanism behind the thermostability enhancement of XynM9, we 
performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to compare it with XynM2. The 
MD simulations were executed for 200 ns at 353 K using structures modeled by AF2. 
The root mean square deviation (RMSD) of these structures reached equilibration 
after 50 ns (Figure S4). The root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) after equilibration 
was measured to reflect the mobility of amino acid residues.38 XynM9 exhibits lower 
fluctuations in four distinct regions compared to XynM2 : The N-terminal region 
(from Gln1 to Asn5); the region 1 (from Gly50 to Tyr73, including finger4); the cord 
region (from Thr 95 to Ala102); the region 2 (from Tyr137 to Asn165, including 
Helix) (Figure S5 and Figure 2A~B). Reduced fluctuations in these areas suggest that 
XynM9 has greater stability than XynM2.38 Interestingly, there are six mutational 


--- Page 16 ---

positions (19, 31, 40, 41, 109, and 177) located outside these four regions (Figure 2A). 
This implies that mutations in XynM9 exert a long-distance influence to improve its 
overall stability.

the analysis,40 while those with an occurrence lower than 50% were marked as 0. 
Only stable salt bridges with an occurrence rate greater than 20% were considered.22 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to compare the major 
conformation of XynM2 and XynM9.41 As illustrated in Figure 2C~D, XynM9 
exhibits more clustered conformations, with one major and one minor group, whereas 
XynM2 displays more dispersed conformations, with one major and two minor groups.

We compared the hydrogen bond (H-bond) networks between XynM2 and XynM9 
(Figure 2F~G). The mutation T177V disrupts the H-bond between Thr177 and Tyr35. 
However, this change incurs six H-bonds in XynM9 but only five in XynM2 between 
Finger 3 and Finger 4 (Figure 2E and S5). There is a new H-bond formed between 
Gly94 and Ser72 in XynM9 with the probability of 94% (Figure 2H). The probability 
of salt-bridge formation between Asp97 and Arg116 in XynM9 is 55%, which is 7% 
higher than in XynM2 (48%). The mutation A57N raises the hydrogen bond 
probability to 93% between Ala59 and Val193in XynM9, which is 24% higher 
compared to XynM2 (69%) (Figure 2H). The mutation S19T introduces a new 
H-bond between Thr3 and Trp17 in XynM9, with the probability of 73%. The 
mutation E109Y leads to a different H-bond network involving Glu91, Asp111, 
Gln115, Arg141, and Arg145 in XynM9 (Figure 2H). The mutations G40S and D41G 
incur an additional H-bond between Finger 1 and 2 in XynM9 compared to XynM2 
(Figure 2H and S5). Introducing a proline residue into β-turns (T2) by E31P increases 
the rigidity of XynM9.42 
Dynamic Cross-Correlation Matrix (DCCM) reflects the correlation coefficients (Cij) 
between all pairs of Cα atoms.43 Overall, XynM9 exhibits similar correlated regions 
to XynM2 but has fewer anti-correlated regions, suggesting greater stability compared 
to XynM2 (Figure 3A). Nevertheless, the thumb and finger regions in XynM9 show 
stronger anti-correlation than those in XynM2, suggesting increased flexibility in this 
region of XynM9 (Figure 3A). MD trajectories further reveal that the thumb region 


--- Page 19 ---

and residue Trp18 are more dynamic in XynM9 (Figure 3B). The increased flexibility 
in the thumb region may facilitate substrate binding to XynM9.44 The 
substrate-binding cleft (signified by the distance between the conserved Pro126 and 
Trp18 residues44, 45) in XynM9 is narrower than that in XynM2 (Figure 3C). 
Additionally, MM/PBSA calculations for the xylanase-xylohexaose complexes reveal 
that XynM9 has the binding free energy of -47.3 kcal mol-1, which is significantly 
lower than that of XynM2 (-25.3 kcal mol-1) (Table S5). These results are in 
agreement with XynM9 having a lower Km than XynM2 (Table 3). 
XynM9 has Higher Activity in the Harsh Condition  
We compared the activities between XynM9 and XynM2 under the harsh conditions 
(80 C and pH 10). Our results demonstrate that the activity of XynM9 is 3.2-fold 
higher than that of XynM2. Furthermore, after incubation for 1 h, the residual activity 
of XynM9 is 4.0-fold higher than that of XynM2 (Figure 3E). Electrostatics analysis 
shows that the four mutations (E31P, D40S, A57N, and D109Y) increase the positive 
surface charge of XynM9 (Figure S6).  
We compared the hydrolytic effects of wheat straw between XynM2 and XynM9 in 
the harsh conditions (80°C and pH10) normally employed in the pulp industry. After 
24 hours of hydrolysis by XynM9, the pulp quality was significantly improved 
(Figure 3F): The hemicellulose content decreased from 25.3% to 13.5%, the lignin 
content decreased from 9.4% to 6.8%, and the cellulose content increased from 32.3% 
to 45.9%. In contrast, applying XynM2 only marginally improved the pulp quality: 


--- Page 20 ---

The hemicellulose content slightly decreased from 25.3% to 22.8%, the lignin content 
slightly decreased from 9.4% to 8.6%, and the cellulose content mildly increased from 
32.3% to 35.6%.

DISCUSSION 
Xylanase is a key biocatalyst for degrading hemicellulose and has been widely used 
in the paper and pulp industry. It can improve paper whiteness and reduce the usage 
of chlorine-based bleaching chemicals.4 However, xylanase needs to function under 
the high temperatures and alkaline conditions.5 Xylanase from Paecilomyces 
thermophila (XynA) has potential to be used in the pulp industry due to its high 
activity in the alkaline conditions with the optimal temperature at 65 °C. Wu et al. 
introduced a disulfide bond in its N-terminal region and increased its optimal 
temperature to 75 °C (XynM2).8 However, its activity still quickly diminishes in 
harsh conditions of the pulp industry (80~85°C, pH>10).7 We aim to further enhance 


--- Page 23 ---

its longevity using a computer-aided rational strategy, which is based on the balance 
between folding free energy change (ΔΔGfold) and sequence conservation.  
Mutants with negative ΔΔGfold values are predicted to have higher thermostability.46 
Different algorithms apply different thresholds for accurate estimation: -2 kcal mol-1 
for Rosetta and -1 kcal mol-1 for FoldX, respectively.28 However, relying solely on 
ΔΔGfold is insufficient for designing a robust and active biocatalyst. For instance, 
S16Y mutant has the calculated ΔΔGfold of -8.8 kcal mol-1 and a ΔTm of 7 °C. 
Unfortunately, it only maintains less than 3% activity (Table S2). Structure analysis 
suggests that the Tyr16 side chain blocks the substrate binding pocket, thereby 
affecting the enzyme's activity (Figure S7). The solely energy-based approach 
disregards residues critical for enzymatic activity, leading to mutations that increase 
thermostability but decrease activity. Substitution with highly conserved residues 
benefits both enzymatic activity and thermostability.26 Thus, we combined sequence 
conservation and ΔΔGfold calculation to select potential mutations. 
 We generated three virtual permutation libraries (including 3686 mutations) based 
on ΔΔGfold calculations and screened their conservation for selecting beneficial 
mutations. Using the criteria outlined in Table 1, we proposed eighteen mutations. 
After experimental testing, eight single mutants demonstrated both higher activity and 
stability. All mutations with increased thermostability also exhibited higher activity, 
indicating that our strategy is quite successful (Figure 1D). Using the same frequency 
threshold (>10%), Rosetta Cartesian_ddg (ΔΔGfold < -2.0 kcal mol-1), Rosetta 


--- Page 24 ---

ddg_monomer (ΔΔGfold < -2.0 kcal mol-1), and FoldX (ΔΔGfold < -1.0 kcal mol-1) 
successfully estimated 50%, 33%, and 14% beneficial mutations, individually. The 
varing accuracy of these algorithms is attributable to their different functions in 
calculating free energy changes.28 Rosetta ddg_monomer requires many replicates 
with strong constraints. In comparison, Rosetta Cartesian_ddg allows small local 
backbone movements during refinement,17 which improves the Pearson correlation 
between the estimated and experimentally measured ΔΔGfold values.17 Therefore, the 
Rosetta 
Cartesian_ddg 
energy 
function 
(opt-nov15)17 
outperforms 
Rosetta 
ddg_monomer energy function (talaris2014)29 in many prediction tests. FoldX has 
lower accuracy in our case, possibly due to the limitations of backbone stiffness 
during sampling.19, 47, 48 We initially identified five beneficial mutations using the 
recommended criteria, but these were insufficient to meet the thermostability 
requirement of the paper and pulp industry. Consequently, we adjusted the balance 
between energy and conservation by applying varied threshold, leading to the 
identification of four additional candidates (E31P, G40S, D41G, Q151T) (Table 1). 
Among them, three were experimentally confirmed to be beneficial.  
In our approach, we considered both conservation enhancement and energy 
reduction as criteria, and aimed balance the strictness of these two conditions. When 
one criterion was applied more rigorously, we could still identify effective mutations 
by slightly relaxing the other criterion (Table 1 and Figure 1). This trade-off is akin to 
the Yin and Yang concept in Chinese philosophy, which symbolizes the balance of 


--- Page 25 ---

complementary forces.49 In computer-aided enzyme engineering, predictions often 
include many false negatives and false positives. By adjusting energy and 
conservation criteria, we were able to reduc these false-negative and false-positive 
mutations. Consequently, our strategy achieved a high success rate in predictions: out 
of the eleven candidates proposed by Rosetta Cartesian_ddg, seven were 
experimentally verified as beneficial mutations (Table 2).  
Combining beneficial mutations commonly results in a superior variant.37 However, 
simply combining all beneficial mutations (XynM10) does not yield the best 
performance, although XynM10 still significantly outperforms XynM2 (Figure 1E). 
By calculating ΔΔGfold for all possible combinations using Rosetta Cartesian_ddg, we 
found that XynM9 with seven mutations has the lowest calculated ΔGfold (Figure 1F). 
Compared to XynM2, its optimal reaction temperature increases from 75 °C to 85 °C, 
its Tm increases from 83 °C to 93 °C, and its half-life extends to 5.8 hours (11-fold) at 
85 °C. Moreover, its catalytic efficiency improves by 57%, reaching 3926 s-1 mM-1 
(Table 3). These results indicate that our strategy of computer-aided combination is 
very helpful in designing the most powerful variant. 
XynM9, compared to XynM2, exhibits more stable intramolecular interactions 
(hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions) in the N-terminal, the region 1, the cord, and 
the region 2 (Figure 2). MD simulations analysis shows lower RMSF for its catalytic 
amino acids (Glu86 and Glu178), suggesting dampened dynamics of these key 
residues (Figure 2A). Dynamics of Glu178 is essential for catalysis as the acid/base.23 


--- Page 26 ---

Thus, kcat for XynM9 is lower than that for XynM2. However, MD analysis reveals a 
narrower substrate-binding cleft in XynM9 (Figure 3C), which leads to higher 
substrate binding affinity (Km decreases from 2.4 to 0.7 mM) (Table 3) and decreased 
binding free energy (-22 kcal mol-1) (Table S5). As a result, its catalytic efficiency 
(kcat/Km) is improved by 57% (Table 3). In addition, four mutations (E31P, D40S, 
A57N, and D109Y) increase the electrostatic positive charge on the protein surface 
(Figure S6), potentially increasing alkaline tolerance in GH11 xylanase, aligning with 
findings from previous studies. 50,51 
Numerous strategies have been successfully employed to design and enhance the 
thermostability of xylanase.52-58 For example, introducing disulfide bonds,53 sandwich 
fusion with CBM9_2,54 and targeted modifications of the N-terminus and core 
regions55 have significantly increased the melting temperatures of various xylanases, 
such as DSB1 (74°C), C2-XYN-C2 (53°C), and reATX11A41/cord (72°C). Surface 
engineering, such as substituting Ser/Thr with Arg or Thr,57, 58 has also improved 
thermostability and optimal temperatures (Table S6). These rational design strategies, 
while requiring relatively minimal effort, have produced xylanase mutants with 
improved thermostability. However, the thermostability and activity levels remain 
insufficient for the stringent requirements of the paper industry. In contrast, Wu et al.52 
utilized a combination strategy based on energy calculations and molecular dynamics 
(MD) simulations. This approach involved screening 105 XynCDBFV mutants and 
identifying 10 mutations that enhanced thermostability. The combination of these 


--- Page 27 ---

mutations increased the optimal temperature of XynCDBFV-m to 65°C, with a 
substantial enzyme activity of 11,000 U mg-1. In our study, we employed a 
computer-aided approach integrating folding free energy calculations and 
evolutionary analysis that resulted in the design of XynM9, a mutant that exhibits 
superior activity and thermostability compared to other reported strategies. XynM9 
achieved a melting temperature of 93°C and an enzyme activity of 12,630 U mg-1. It 
demonstrated exceptional efficacy in removing both hemicellulose and lignin from 
wheat straw fibers under harsh conditions (80 °C and pH 10), indicating its excellent 
potential for application in the paper and pulp industry. More importantly, our 
screening method has been optimized to identify more beneficial mutations with a 
reasonable experimental workload, thus significantly reducing both effort and cost.  
CONCLUSION 
By balancing energy and conservation with the Yin-and-Yang theory, we have 
developed an accurate, cost-effective, and efficient strategy to engineer a 
hyper-thermophilic and highly active xylanase. It has demonstrated exceptional 
efficacy in removing hemicellulose and lignin under harsh conditions (80 °C and pH 
10), which shows great potential application in the paper and pulp industry. Our 
integrated strategy provides guidance in enzyme engineering to improve both 
thermostability and activity.
