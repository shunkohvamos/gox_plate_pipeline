Abstract: Improving the speciﬁc activity and thermostability of psychrophilic xylosidase is important
for improving its enzymatic performance and promoting its industrial application. Herein, a psy-
chrophilic xylosidase AX543 exhibited activity in the temperature range between 0 and 35 ◦C, with
optimum activity at 20 ◦C, which is lower than that of other reported psychrophilic xylosidases. The
thermostability, speciﬁc activity, and catalytic efﬁciency of the site-directed variants G110S, Q201R,
and L2 were signiﬁcantly enhanced, without affecting the optimal reaction temperature. Comparative
protein structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulation indicated that these improvements
might be the result of the increased hydrogen bonds interaction and improved structural rigidity. Fur-
thermore, homologous module substitution with four segments demonstrated that the psychrophilic
characteristics of AX543 are the results of the whole protein structure, and the C-terminal segment
A4 appears to be more essential in determining psychrophilic characteristics, exhibiting potentiality
to produce more psychrophilic xylosidases. This study provides valuable structural information on
psychrophilic xylosidases and also offers attractive modiﬁcation strategies to modify catalytic activity,
thermostability, and optimal reaction temperature.

1. Introduction
β-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the xylan enzyme degradation
system, which can completely decompose xylan by synergistic action with xylanase [1].
Xylosidase has been widely used in food processing, such as for reducing the viscosity
and turbidity of beer and wine, promoting the liquefaction of coffee mucus, improving
the extraction rate of spices and dyes, and producing xylose and other high value-added
products such as xylitol [2]. In order to reduce the loss of active ingredients, ﬂavor sub-
stances, and nutrients in food products, some food processing procedures, such as wine
fermentation and fruit juice clariﬁcation, usually need to be carried out at low temperatures
(<30 ◦C). However, the vast majority of discovered xylosidases belong to medium-high
temperature enzymes, with the optimal reaction temperature from 40 ◦C to 60 ◦C, and
their activities at low temperature conditions are very weak, or even completely lost
(http://www.brenda-enzymes.org (accessed on 15 June 2022)) [3]. Psychrophilic xylosi-
dases might provide a promising new way to solve this problem, since they have high
catalytic activity at a low temperature range, with the optimal reaction temperatures below
30 ◦C [4]. So far, only a few psychrophilic xylosidases have been previously reported,
as shown in Table 1 [5–11]. Our group has been exploring psychrophilic xylosidases
from different environments, and reported a novel psychrophilic xylosidase AX543 from
Acremonium sp. WCQ6A after the activity screening of many xylosidase candidates [12].

In order to display efﬁcient catalytic activity in cold conditions, protein structures
of psychrophilic enzymes must be ﬂexible. Previous studies have shown that the ﬂexible
protein structure of psychrophilic enzymes was likely damaged during enzyme processing;
thus, the commercial application of these reported psychrophilic xylosidases were limited
by their poor thermostability and low speciﬁc activity [4]. To overcome this disadvantage,
one strategies is to continuously isolate more psychrophilic xylosidases from the natural
environment and gene databases, but this is still labor and time consuming, as well as
full of uncertainty [13]. Instead of enzyme mining, desired enzymes can be generated by
enzyme engineering based on the relationship between protein structure and function [14].
It has generally been assumed that mesophilic and thermophilic enzymes have a tendency
to be more rigid, whereas psychrophilic enzymes are associated with structure ﬂexibility [4].
Compared with mesophilic and thermophilic enzymes, psychrophilic enzymes subtly ad-
just their amino acid composition, e.g., by increasing the content of glycine, reducing the
content of proline and arginine, and developing loop regions [13–17]. For example, the ra-
tios of proline and arginine in cold-active valine dehydrogenase from Cytophaga sp. KUC-1
(2.16% and 2.97%) are lower than those of medium temperature valine dehydrogenase from
Streptomyces coelicolor (4.13% and 6.06%) and Streptomyces fradiae (4.32% and 7.84%) [18].
The cold-active amylase AHA has less arginine (2.9% vs. 5.6%) and prolines (2.9% vs. 4.2%)
compared with the thermophilic amylase PPA [19]. Besides, psychrophilic dehydrogenase
also possesses lower amounts of arginine and higher amounts of glycine in comparison
with its mesophilic and thermophilic homologs [20].
Among reported psychrophilic xylosidases, AX543 exhibited the lowest optimal reac-
tion temperature (20 ◦C, Table 1). Notably, a thermophilic xylosidase Xyl43A (AHC72382.1)
from Humicola insolens, sharing the highest amino acid sequence identity (80%) with AX543,
displayed its optimum reaction temperature at 50 ◦C [21]. Herein, based on the multi-
sequence alignment, molecular dynamics simulation, and rational/semi-rational mutagen-
esis analysis of these two xylosidases, this comparative study has enabled us to identify
possible key factors affecting the cold adaptation of xylosidase AX543, including the related
regions, amino acid sites, and molecular bond forces. Moreover, the speciﬁc activity and
thermostability of AX543 were further improved by reducing the structural ﬂexibility.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Strains, Plasmids, and Biochemical Reagents
The plasmids were ampliﬁed with Escherichia coli DH5α and expressed with E. coli
BL21 (DE3) as the prokaryotic host. E. coli strains were cultured in LB medium (0.5% w/v
yeast extract, 1% w/v peptone, and 1% w/v NaCl), with kanamycin (100 µg/mL) added
to the LB medium. Phusion DNA polymerase, restriction endonuclease, and T4 DNA
ligase were provided by Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc (Shanghai, China). DNA puriﬁcation
kits and plasmid extraction kits were purchased from Tiangen (Beijing, China). Substate
4-nitrophenyl-β-D-xylopyranoside (pNPX) was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO,
USA). Other chemical reagents were of analytical grade and commercially available.

2.2. Protein Sequence and Structure Analysis
The amino acid sequence of AX543 was compared with other GH43 family xylosi-
dases using clustalW software (https://www.genome.jp/tools-bin/clustalw (accessed
on 10 March 2022)).
The amino acid composition of psychrophilic, mesophilic, and
thermophilic counterparts was calculated using Vector NTI software (version 10.0, In-
vitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The protein structures of psychrophilic xylosidase AX543,
thermophilic xylosidase Xyl43A, and the variants were predicted using SWISS-MODEL
(https://swissmodel.expasy.org/ (accessed on 20 May 2022)), and then the protein struc-
tures and intermolecular forces were analyzed by PyMOL software (https://pymol.org/2/
(accessed on 25 May 2022)). The root mean square deviation (RMSD) between two proteins
was calculated by PyMOL software (accessed on 22 July 2022).
2.3. Molecular Dynamic Simulation
Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was performed to compare the dynamic proper-
ties of AX543 at 300 K and 350 K using GROMACS 4.5.5 package with the AMBER99SB
force ﬁeld. The initial model of AX543 was solvated with a box of TIP3P water molecules;
then the energy minimizations were carried out with 2000 steps of steepest descent followed
by 2000 steps of conjugate gradient. For the next MD simulation steps, the system was
gradually heated and equilibrated, and the simulation time was 10 ns. Each simulation
was repeated three times, with the same initial conﬁgurations. The root means square
ﬂuctuation (RMSF) was calculated for the protein backbone atoms using least-squares
ﬁtting.
2.4. Site-Directed Mutagenesis
The gene sequences of wild-type AX543 and Xyl43A, respectively, were ampliﬁed
with primers (Table S1). The PCR fragments were digested by EcoR I and Not I, ligated
into pET-28a(+) vector, and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). In order to obtain the
site-directed variants, a series of PCR products of the variants were ampliﬁed by whole
plasmid PCR with the corresponding primers and the plasmid of pET-AX543 as a DNA
template (Table S1). After removing the template plasmid DNA digested by DpnI, the PCR
products were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) to produce recombinant variant plasmids
pET28-G110S, pET28-G216A, pET28-A119P, pET28-K125P, pET28-K285R, pET28-Q201R,
pET28-L1, pET28-L2, pET28-L3, and pET28-L4.
In order to evaluate the effects of four segments (A1, A2, A3, and A4) on the optimal
reaction temperature of AX543, the 10 chimeric variants (R1–R10) were constructed by
overlap PCR using wild-type AX543 or Xyl43A as a template. The ﬁnal PCR fragments of
the correct size were digested by EcoR I and Not I and ligated into the pET-28a(+) vector,
and were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). All constructed variants were conﬁrmed by
DNA sequencing (GENEWIZ, Suzhou, China).
2.5. Expression and Puriﬁcation of Wild-Type and Variants
The wild-type and the variants were incubated in LB medium containing 100 µg/mL
kanamycin at 37 ◦C for 2 h, and then were induced by the addition of 1 mM Isopropyl-
β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 12 h at 25 ◦C. In order to obtain the recombinant
protein, the variants were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000× g (4 ◦C for 15 min) and
resuspended in 10 mM phosphate buffer (8 g/L NaCl, 3.58 g/L Na2HPO4·12H2O, 0.2 g/L
KCl, 0.27 g/L KH2PO4, pH 7.4). After being disintegrated by an ultrasonic cell disintegrator
(Ningbo Xinzhi Instrument, Ningbo, China), the intracellular crude proteins were obtained
by further centrifugation at 12,000× g (4 ◦C for 10 min) to remove the cell debris. The
recombinant proteins were puriﬁed by nickel afﬁnity chromatography (GE Health-care,
Uppsala, Sweden) with 10 to 500 mM imidazole in buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl,
pH 8.0). The protein fractions corresponding to different imidazole concentrations were
collected and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

The protein concentration was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA).
2.6. Enzyme Activity Assays and Biochemical Characterization
To determine the xylosidase activity of the wild-type and variants, each reaction
system contained 450 µL of pNPX substrate (2 mM) and 50 µL of protein sample (2 µM); the
releasing para-nitrophenol (pNP) was determined to occur at 405 nm by spectrophotometer
(MD SpectraMax190, Chatsworth, CA, USA). The optimum temperature for AX543 activity
was determined at different temperatures, between 0–50 ◦C, and a pH of 6.0. The optimal
pH for enzyme activity was measured using 0.2 M citric acid-Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 4.0–8.0)
or 0.2 M glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0–9.0) at the optimum temperature. After incubation at
40 ◦C for different periods of time, the thermal stabilities of the enzymes were determined
by measuring the residual activity at pH 6.0 and 20 ◦C.
The speciﬁc activities of wide-type AX543 and its variants were assayed under the
optimum reaction conditions. The kinetic parameters of wide-type AX543 and its variants
were determined in McIlvaine buffer containing 450 µL pNPX (0.1 to 2 mM) with 50 µL of
2 µM protein sample at 20 ◦C and pH 6.0 for 5 min. Km and Vmax values were determined on
the basis of Lineweaver–Burk plots using GraphPad Prism software (Version 5.0, GraphPad
Soft-ware Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA), and all the experiments were carried out three times.
3. Results and Discussions
3.1. Expression and Biochemical Characterization of Xylosidase AX543 in E. coli
Psychrophilic xylosidases have great potential for food and other industries requiring
low temperature conditions, and a psychrophilic xylosidase AX543 was previously cloned
and expressed in Komagataella phafﬁi by our research group [12]. In this study, in order
to facilitate the following mutagenesis of AX543, the gene of AX543 was successfully
expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) because of its fast growth rate and easy molecular operation.
After inducing the recombinant protein with IPTG, the hydrolysis activity of crude enzyme
AX543 was detected, and no activity was shown in the cultures harboring an empty
plasmid pET-28a(+). The recombinant protein of AX543 was puriﬁed to homogeneity at
200 mM imidazole by Ni-afﬁnity chromatography. The SDS-PAGE gel showed a single
band of molecular mass of approximately 42 kDa (Figure 1), which is consistent with its
calculated molecular mass. The optimal pH of AX543 is 6.0 (Figure 2). AX543 exhibited its
hydrolytic activity from 0–35 ◦C, with its maximum activities at 20 ◦C, and still retained
38.64% and 18.02% relative activity at 5 ◦C and 0 ◦C, respectively (Figure 2). Among the
reported psychrophilic xylosidases, AX543 has the lowest optimal reaction temperature
(Table 1). Besides, similar to the other psychrophilic enzymes [3,4], AX543 displayed poor
thermostability (Figure 3), only retaining about 51.05% of its initial activity at 40 ◦C for
5 min, and losing all activity at 40 ◦C for 1 h. Notably, 8 out of 10 reported psychrophilic
xylosidases all belong to GH43 family, which suggests that the GH43 family might be a
desirable enzyme database for mining cold-active xylosidases (Table 1).
3.2. Improvement of Speciﬁc Activity and Thermostability by Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Previous studies reported that psychrophilic enzymes subtly adjust their amino acid
composition and reduce intramolecular interactions (such as hydrogen bonds, salt bridges,
and disulﬁde bonds), so that their protein structure and active sites become more ﬂexi-
ble and can better adapt to a low temperature environment [3]. Based on the multiple
sequence alignment with other reported xylosidases from databases and the literature,
thermophilic xylosidase Xyl43A (from Humicola insolens) and PtXyl43 (from Paecilomyces
thermophila) were found to share a high amino acid sequence identity of 80% and 67%,
respectively, with psychrophilic xylosidase AX543 [22]. The three-dimensional structures
of low-temperature xylosidase AX543, high-temperature xylosidases Xyl43A, and PtXyl43
(with 80% shared identity) were established using xylosidase RS-223 (PDB:4MLG) as a
template. The similarities of these xylosidases AX543, Xyl43A, and PtXyl43 to the template

RS-223 are 65%, 68%, 64%, and the identities are 56%, 59%, 53%, respectively. Besides,
GMQE and QMEANDisCo global scores are parameters which provide an overall model
quality measurement between 0 and 1, with higher numbers indicating higher expected
quality. The GMQE and QMEANDisCo global scores for the three-dimensional structural
models are all above 0.8, which suggests that they are of high quality. The enzymatic
property of xylosidase RS-223 has not yet been reported.

Compared with thermophilic xylosidases Xyl43A and PtXyl43, AX543 has a higher
glycine ratio than Xyl43A and PtXyl43, and AX543 contains extra glycine at the 110 and
216 sites (Figure 4). Moreover, the ratio of proline in AX543 is lower than in Xyl43A and
PtXyl43 (Table 2), the corresponding site of 119 A of AX543 is proline 123P in Xyl43A, and
the corresponding site of 125 K of AX543 is proline 129 P in PtXyl43 (Figure 4). Further-
more, as shown in Table 2, the number of total hydrogen bonds and arginine-mediated
hydrogen bonds of AX543 were less than that of high temperature xylosidase Xyl43A.
The arginine/lysine ratio of AX543 is also lower than that of Xyl43A and PtXyl43. It was
determined that the corresponding site of 201 in AX543 is arginine in Xyl43A, and the
corresponding site of 285 in AX543 is also arginine (Figure 4).

graminearum PH-1 (ESU18126.1). The identical amino acids are marked with dark and light blue
backgrounds. Three conserved catalytic residues of AX543 (Asp12, Asp131, and Glu225) are marked
in red letters, and the mutation sites and mutation loop regions are labeled with a solid orange frame
and a dotted orange frame, respectively.
To explore the effects of glycine, proline, and arginine on the psychrophilic character-
istics of AX543, the corresponding single site-directed variants designed as G110S, G216A,
A119P, K125P, Q201R, and K285R were successfully constructed and expressed (Figure 1).
All these variants exhibited their highest activity at 20 ◦C (Figure 2), which is identical to the
wild type. Notably, AX543 lost nearly all activity after 1 h at 40 ◦C, and the thermostability
of G110S and Q201R were signiﬁcantly improved (Figure 3), retaining 14.36% and 8.02%
relative activity, respectively, after 1 h at 40 ◦C. Moreover, the speciﬁc activities of G11
and Q201R increased to 145.17% and 130.00%, respectively, of the wild type (Figure 3).
The catalytic efﬁciencies (kcat/Km) of 201R, G110S, and L2 increased to 9.49, 7.23, and
8.12 (1/s·mM), respectively, and the catalytic efﬁciency (kcat/Km) of wild type AX543 is
only 4.64 (1/s·mM).

Further intermolecular interaction analysis showed that G110S has four more hydro-
gen bonds with the surrounding sites than AX543 (6 vs. 2), and Q201R has one more
hydrogen bond than the wild-type (3 vs. 2) (Figure 5). These introduced hydrogen bonds
might reduce the ﬂexibility of the protein structure and improve their thermostability [3].
These results showed that reduced glycine and increased arginine are applicable for im-
proving the thermostability for xylosidases without affecting the optimal reaction activity.
Previous studies have also reported that increasing the overall rigidity of protein, while
minimizing its inﬂuence on the active site could improve thermostability, either without
changing catalytic activity, or ideally, while positively promoting the catalytic activity of

3.3. Effects of Flexible Loop Regions on Cold-Adaptation of AX543
Among the potential affecting factors, loop region is assumed as one of the main factors
leading to the ﬂexibility of the enzyme molecular structure, including the differences in
number, length, amino acid composition, and molecular inter-atomic forces in the loop
regions [24]. For example, loop L3 of low-temperature glucosidase BglU is crucial to its cold-
active characteristics [25]. Low-temperature xylosidase XynGR40 has more loop regions
than medium-temperature xylanase, as identiﬁed through crystal structure analysis [26,27].
The thermostability of endoglucanase decreases after the β-sheet is mutated into the
loop region [28]. Moreover, loop regions are also involved in the formation of substrate
binding sites and active sites, thus affecting enzyme characteristics. The loop region of
GH11 xylanases involves substrate recognition and catalysis [29], and the loop regions of
endoglucanases and polygalacturonases can also modulate their catalytic efﬁciency [30,31].
In this study, based on the superimposed structural analysis between xylosidase AX543
and its mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts Xyl43A and PtXyl43, four signiﬁcantly

different loop regions were identiﬁed, including loop1 (E31-A46), loop2 (S54-V59), loop3
(G170-Q183), and loop4 (E209-P213) of AX543 (Figure 6). The corresponding protein struc-
tures of these four regions in the template for xylosidase RS-223 are also loops. Molecular
dynamics simulation of AX543 and high-temperature enzyme Xyl43A were further com-
paratively analyzed at 300 K by Gromacs software, and the ﬂexible variation of the whole
protein structures was analyzed using the average RMSF value (Figure 7). RMSF value
refers to the average amplitude of each atom relative to the reference position and reﬂects
the overall ﬂexible state of the system; the larger value represents the stronger amino acid
ﬂexibility of the protein [32]. Compared with xylosidase Xyl43A, the molecular structures
of loop1, loop2, and loop3 regions of AX543 exhibited higher RMSF values than those of the
corresponding regions in Xyl43A, perhaps indicating the conformation instability of these
four loop regions. Consequently, to validate the effects of the loop region, the four loop
regions of AX543 were substituted with the corresponding region of Xyl43A to produce the
variants of L1, L2, L3, and L4, respectively, and these four variants were further successfully
constructed, expressed, and puriﬁed in E. coli (Figure 1).

and Xyl43A (green). The three conserved AX543 catalytic residues (Asp12, Asp131, and Glu225) are
marked with blue triangles.
The optimal temperatures of variants L1, L2, L3, and L4 were found to still be 20 ◦C,
which is identical to that of the wild type. Only the hybrid enzyme L2 was more stable than
the wild type, which retained 82.71% relative activity at 40 ◦C for 5 min and 52.25% relative
activity at 40 ◦C for 20 min, respectively (Figure 3). Moreover, the speciﬁc activity of L2
signiﬁcantly increased to 141.31% of the wild type enzymes (Figure 3), and the catalytic
efﬁciency also increased (Table 3). Further intermolecular force analysis indicated that the
number of hydrogen bonds in the loop2 region increased compared with the wild type,
and the number of internal hydrogen bonds in the loop2 region was identical to the wild
type, but another 2 hydrogen bonds were found between the loop2 region of Y285 and
Y290 in AX543 (Figure 5). This increased interaction is beneﬁcial to maintain the structural
stability of the L2 region, thus reducing the ﬂuctuation of main chain atoms. Previous
studies reported that introducing hydrogen bonds in the enzyme protein molecules can
increase the energy barrier at high temperatures, further improving the enzyme activity
and thermal stability [33].

3.4. Homologous Module Substitution between Psychrophilic and Thermophilic Xylosidases
In this study, the rational site-directed amino acid and short loop region variants of
AX543 resulted in three variants exhibiting improved thermostability, without any change
in the optimal reaction temperature. Thereby, it is speculated that the low optimal reaction
temperature of AX543 is not due to a single amino acid site or loop region, but a network
of multiple regions. In order to obtain more structural information regarding the low
optimal reaction temperature of xylosidase AX543, semi-rational homologous module

substitution was applied in the following research. The homologous substitution strategy
has been previously applied to various proteins, which can lead to the design of proteins
with enhanced biological performance to meet the requirements of speciﬁc research and
technological goals [34,35]. Previously, after fusion of the thermostabilizing domain A2 of
xylanase XynA to the N-terminal region of Xyn2, the optimal temperature of the hybrid
enzyme was 10 ◦C higher than for Xyn2, and its thermostability was also improved [36].
The multiple substitutions between two xylanases produced by Streptomyces lividans has
shown that the C-terminal region of xylanase plays an important role in determining the
optimal temperature [37].
In this study, the amino acid sequences of psychrophilic xylosidases AX543 and
thermophilic xylosidases Xyl43A have signiﬁcant homology (the highest identity at 80%),
but quite different optimal temperatures (20 ◦C vs. 50 ◦C). Previous studies also reported
that thermophilic and mesophilic isoenzymes have high homology (40–80%), but often
exhibit different performances, including thermal stability and catalytic efﬁciency [38]. To
further analyze the cold-active property, as well as to study the effect of the exchange of
homologous segments, the whole sequence of AX543 was divided into four segments: A1
(M1-K67), A2(T68-G160), A3 (D161-K231), and A4 (H232-D324) (Figure 8). This design
strategy was based on the length, the position of three active sites, and the secondary
structures, which ensures the preservation of the catalytic domain and catalytic activity.
Among these four segments, segment A1 contained the active site of D12, loop1, and loop2
region; segment A2 contained active site of D131; segment A3 contained the active site
of E225, loop3, and loop4. There was no active site in segment A4 (Figure 4). As shown
in Figure 8, the chimeric enzymes designated as R1-R10 were constructed by substituting
segments from A1-A4 segments of the AX543 gene with corresponding X1-X4 segments
of Xyl43A and in turn, substituting the Xyl43A gene with the corresponding segments of
AX543. Finally, these 10 hybrid genes, R1-R10, were successfully constructed and expressed
in E. coli (Figure 1).

Figure 8. The schematic diagram of the molecular construction of chimeras.
As shown in Figure 9, all of the optimal temperatures of chimeras were admixtures of
those of two parents with the range of 25–40 ◦C (Figure 9A), and the optimal pH for all of
the chimeras is 6.0 (Figure 9B). Chimeras R1, R2, and R3 showed their optimal activity at
25 ◦C; R4, R5, R6, R7 showed their optimal activity at 30 ◦C; and R8, R9, and R10 displayed
their maximum activity at 40 ◦C. Three novel psychrophilic xylosidase—R1, R2, and R3—
were produced, which suggests the generality of the cold-active related regions of AX543,
to some extent. Notably, the optimal temperatures of chimeras R8 (with A3), R9 (with A2),

Foods 2022, 11, 2463

R10 (with A1) are 10 ◦C lower than that of Xyl43A (50 ◦C), respectively, and the optimal
temperature of chimeras R7 is 20 ◦C lower than that of wild type Xyl43A. These results
showed that the low optimal reaction temperature of AX543 is the result of a network of
four segments, and the C-terminal segment A4 of AX543 seems to be more important for
its low optimal reaction activity than the other three segments.

Moreover, compared to AX543, the thermostability of the chimeras, except for R4, was
largely improved (Figure 10A). Chimeras R6 (with A1A1), R8 (with A3), R9 (with A2), and
R10 (with A1) retained above 81% of relative residual activity after incubation at 40 ◦C for
60 min, which is similar to the results for Xyl4, while R7 (with A4) only showed 63.79%
of relative residual activity after incubation at 40 ◦C for 60 min, which suggests that the
C-terminal segment A4 has the highest impact on the poor thermostability of psychrophilic
xylosidase AX543.
Figure 10. The thermostability (A) and speciﬁc activities (B) of puriﬁed xylosidase AX543 and
its chimeras.
The speciﬁc activities of all variants were compared at both the optimal reaction tem-
perature and low temperature, and it was found that the speciﬁc activities of all chimeras,
except for R1, increased signiﬁcantly (Figure 10B). Speciﬁcally, the particular activities of
R10 at 20 ◦C were 14.66 fold that of AX543. In addition, the catalytic efﬁciencies (Kcat/km)
of these variants, except for R1 and R4, were improved, as shown in Table 4. The enhanced
speciﬁc activity and catalytic efﬁciency of the variants by segment substitution might be
due to the high speciﬁc activity and catalytic efﬁciency of Xyl43A. This result suggests that
segment substitution is an effective strategy for acquiring novel psychrophilic xylosidases.
In addition, the 3D structure of its variants are all modeled and aligned with wide-type
(AX543 and Xyl43A, Figure 11). The RMSD value can reﬂect the differences between two
protein structures. Interestingly, the RMSD values between four variants (R6, R7, R9, or R10)
and Xyl43A are higher than the RMSD values between them and AX543 (Table 5), which
means their protein structures are more similar to thermophilic xylosidase Xyl43A. while,


--- Page 13 ---

Foods 2022, 11, 2463

the RMSD values between R1, R2, R4, R5, and Xyl43A are lower than the RMSD values
between them and AX543 (Table 5), which shows their protein structures are more similar
to psychrophilic xylosidase AX543. To some extent, these results are basically consistent
with their optimal reaction temperature, speciﬁc activity, and thermostability.

4. Conclusions
In this study, the thermal stability and activity of psychrophilic enzymes were signiﬁ-
cantly improved by mutagenesis, and C-terminal segment A4 of AX543 appears to be more
essential in determining its psychrophilic characteristics. This study provides insight into
the cold adaption structural characteristics of psychrophilic xylosidases and also facilitates
the further molecular design of novel potential psychrophilic xylosidases.
