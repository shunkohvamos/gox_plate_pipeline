Abstract: Enzymes used in the synthesis of natural products are potent catalysts, capable of efﬁcient
and stereoselective chemical transformations. Lsd18 catalyzes two sequential epoxidations during
the biosynthesis of lasalocid A, a polyether polyketide natural product. We performed protein
engineering on Lsd18 to improve its thermostability and catalytic activity. Utilizing structure-guided
methods of FoldX and Rosetta-ddG, we designed 15 mutants of Lsd18. Screening of these mutants
using thermal shift assay identiﬁed stabilized variants Lsd18-T189M, Lsd18-S195M, and the double
mutant Lsd18-T189M-S195M. Trypsin digestion, molecular dynamic simulation, circular dichroism
(CD) spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography provided insights into the molecular basis for the
improved enzyme properties. Notably, enhanced hydrophobic interaction within the enzyme core and
interaction of the protein with the FAD cofactor appear to be responsible for its better thermostability.

1. Introduction
Natural products are primary and secondary metabolites produced by living organ-
isms [1], and they are widely utilized as therapeutics, especially for cancer and infectious
diseases [2]. Enzymes that synthesize natural products are nature’s chemists, which possess
the advantages of simplicity, selectivity, safety, and sustainability [3]. Hence, their applica-
tion in organic and industrial synthesis is highly desirable. However, wild-type enzymes
are often unsuitable for commercial application due to their lack of stability at a low or
high pH, elevated temperature, or high organic cosolvent [4]. To overcome such issues,
protein engineering approaches are implemented to achieve improved enzyme stability.
Lasalocid A, a polyether ionophore natural product derived from Streptomyces lasalocidi,
is a widely used veterinary medicine that acts by transporting various cations across the
cell membrane, thereby disrupting cation homeostasis [5]. The total synthesis and the
biosynthesis pathway of Lasalocid A have been reported [6,7]. Lasalocid A biosynthesis
entails two stereospeciﬁc epoxidation of the precursor diene, catalyzed by the ﬂavin-
dependent enzyme Lsd18 [8]. Epoxides, known for their reactivity, hold great promise as
intermediates when constructing pharmaceutical compounds [9]. In organic synthesis, the
enantioselective epoxidation of alkenes remains a long-standing objective. The application

of biological enzymes, such as Lsd18, provides an opportunity for the efﬁcient synthesis
of epoxides.
As a wild-type natural enzyme, Lsd18 has not been engineered before. As a result,
improving its thermostability is the ﬁrst step to promoting its application in the organic
and industrial synthesis of epoxides. In this study, combining structural biology and
bioinformatics, we applied the tools of FoldX and Rossetta-ddG to design mutants of
Lsd18 in order to increase its thermostability. We cloned 15 Lsd18 mutants, 9 of which
were successfully expressed and puriﬁed. Two mutants, T189M and S195M, along with
their double mutants, showed signiﬁcantly increased thermostability. The underlying
mechanism of this improvement was revealed by molecular dynamics simulations and
crystallography. Our study represents the ﬁrst instance of engineering an epoxidase for
enhanced thermostability, introducing new routes for achieving this goal.
2. Results
2.1. Rational and Semi-Rational Designs
To rationally design the mutants of Lsd18 with increased thermostability, we ﬁrst
employed the FoldX algorithm to assess the effect of mutations on the overall stability of
Lsd18 based on the X-ray crustal structure of Lsd18 (PDB: 8UP4). The change in the Gibbs
free energy of folding (∆∆G) for every possible amino acid substitution at each position
was calculated. Mutations were then selected based on the rank order of the calculated
∆∆G values, along with the following criteria: (a) substitutions of residues involved in
FAD binding or catalysis were excluded; (b) proline appearing within secondary structure
elements were excluded; (c) if multiple substitutions at the same position were predicted to
have similar ∆∆G values, then a visual inspection of the local structures was used to guide
mutation selection. Overall, we selected nine mutations, with the calculated ∆∆G values
ranging from −4.59 to −2.57, for further analysis (Table 1).

To enhance the precision of mutation stability predictions, a common practice involves
the combined utilization of Rosetta-ddG and FoldX algorithms [10]. Therefore, we also
utilized Rosetta-ddG to compute ∆∆G values for all saturation mutagenesis variations
of the amino acids within Lsd18. As shown in Table 2, Rosetta-ddG identiﬁed three
additional mutants with relatively large ∆∆G values, making them as potential candidates
for further analysis.

In addition to the aforementioned rational designs, we also incorporated semi-rational
designs into our approach. Based on the crystal structure of Lsd18 in complex with

substrate 1 (PDB: 8WVT), we identiﬁed residues I72, V252, V342, and Y218, which locate
in the active site and directly interact with the substrate, thus playing a pivotal role in
catalysis. To maintain the integrity of these important residues, we focused our attention
on residues H239, S237, and S108, which are in close proximity to the substrate but exhibit
relatively weak interactions. These hydrophilic residues were intended to be mutated
into hydrophobic residues to enhance their interactions with the hydrophobic substrate
compound 1. Following the calculation of ∆∆G by FoldX (Table S1), it was determined
that mutants S108V, S237V, and H239L would not lead to the destabilization of Lsd18.
Therefore, we proceeded to design a triple mutant, denoted as Lsd18-S108V-S237V-H239L,
for further investigation.
Another plausible approach to enhance Lsd18′s stability is to stabilize the FAD bound
in Lsd18 because FAD serves as a vital cofactor for Lsd18. Consequently, we propose that
mutations to the residues in Lsd18 that are in close proximity to FAD might potentially
increase the stability of Lsd18. We rationally designed the mutant R51W to introduce π-π
stacking interactions between Lsd18 and FAD. Furthermore, we designed mutants D52S
and V64D to establish hydrogen bonds between FAD and the protein. Again, based on the
∆∆G values calculated by FoldX (Table S1), these three mutants would not destabilize Lsd18.
Therefore, the triple-mutant Lsd18-R51W-D52S-V64D was also designed for further testing.
2.2. Cloning, Expression and Puriﬁcation of the Designed Mutants
Mutagenesis was performed through overlap PCR. Out of the 15 designed mutants
of Lsd18, 12 were successfully expressed (Figure 1A). Notably, we observed a substantial
increase in the expression levels of mutants Lsd18-T189M, Lsd18-S195M, and Lsd18-T189M-
S195M compared to the wild-type protein. The yield of the three Lsd18 variants from 1 L
of E. coli was 14.25 mg, 17.8 mg, and 18.6 mg, respectively, which represented 2.1-fold,
2.6-fold, and 2.7-fold increases over the yield of the wild-type protein (Figure 1B). Given
that the abundance of soluble proteins often correlates with their thermostability [11,12],
we speculate that Lsd18-T189M, Lsd18-S195M, and Lsd18-T189M-S195M are promising
candidates for stabilized mutants.

2.3. Screening for the Lsd18 Mutants with Increased Thermostability and Catalytic Activity
We applied a thermoshift assay to evaluate the melting temperature (Tm) of the
selected Lsd18 mutants. Tm is a well-established indicator of protein thermostability [13].
We found that the Tm values of Lsd18-T189M, Lsd18-S195M, and Lsd18-T189M-S195M
were increased by 3.0 ◦C, 4.5 ◦C, and 4.8 ◦C, respectively (Figure 2A).

Lsd18-T189M, Lsd18-S195M and Lsd18-T189M-S195M at different temperatures.
As another measure of protein stability, we performed limited proteolysis by incu-
bating these Lsd18 variants and the wild-type protein with a low concentration of trypsin
(2 µg/mL). As shown in Figure S1, after incubating these proteins with trypsin for 45 min,
the wild-type Lsd18 completely disappeared, while some intact proteins remained for
the three mutants, especially for Lsd18-S195M and Lsd18-T189M-S195M. Since the three
Lsd18 mutants were more resistant to both heat denaturation and protease digestion, we
concluded that they have enhanced stabilities compared with the wild-type Lsd18.
It has been reported that the cofactor FAD can enhance the stability of its associated
proteins, leading to increased protein levels [14]. We also observed that the yellower the
color of Lsd18 (attributed to bound FAD), the more stable it was. Therefore, we tested the
content of FAD quantitatively in the three mutants and wild-type Lsd18. As expected, the
FAD content in the mutants Lsd18-T189M, Lsd18-S195M, Lsd18-T189M-S195M increased
by 29.3%, 46.7%, and 38.3%, respectively, compared to the wild-type Lsd18 (Figure 2B).
Since there is often a trade-off between increased stability of an enzyme and its catalytic
activity, we further determined the enzymatic activity of the three mutants. We synthesized
compound 1, a natural substrate analog for Lsd18 (Figure 2C,D), and used this substrate to
evaluate the activity of these mutants (Figure 2E). At the standard catalytic temperature of
30 ◦C, the activities of the three mutants were comparable to that of the wild-type Lsd18.
However, when the reaction temperature was raised to 33 ◦C, both Lsd18-T189M and
Lsd18-S195M exhibited enhanced activity, showing an approximately 10–15% increase
compared to the wild-type enzyme. This suggests that these two mutants can effectively
substitute the wild-type enzyme and perform efﬁciently 33 ◦C. Furthermore, as the reaction

temperature further increased, all three Lsd18 mutants began to display increased activity
compared to the wild-type enzyme. At a reaction temperature of 40 ◦C, Lsd18-S195M
exhibited comparable activity to that of the wild-type enzyme at 40 ◦C. Collectively, these
results demonstrate that our engineering strategy enhanced Lsd18′s thermal stability.
2.4. Molecular Dynamics Analysis of Lsd18-T189M, Lsd18-S195M and Lsd18-T189M-S195M
In order to verify the thermal stability of the mutant systems, we carried out molecular
dynamics simulations of the wild-type Lsd18 system and three mutant architectures (T189M,
S195M, and T189M-S195M), as well as a comparative analysis of structural stability. The
200 ns simulation results revealed that the structures of the four systems are relatively
stable and converge after 100 ns (Figure 3A). However, the wild-type structure ﬂuctuates
greatly compared with the three mutations, T189M and T189M-S195M are relatively stable
during the simulations, and S195M is the most stable during the simulations.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to compare the conformational
stability of the four systems. For the wild-type system, PC1 captured over 47% of the
structural variance, and the second principal component (PC2) accounted for over 15%.
The eigenvalues of the ﬁrst two PCs (PC1 and PC2) captured more than 60% of the motion
of the Lsd18 protein. Hence, the ﬁrst two PCs are sufﬁcient to analyze the dynamic
structure of the Lsd18 protein. A subspace made of wild-type PC1 and PC2 was created,
and the sampling structures of the three mutation systems were projected on it, as shown
in Figure 3B–E, where the color changes from blue to red to reﬂect the structure’s stability
or instability. The wild-type system’s conformation is not stable, and it tends to be in a
narrow, low-energy state (−5, −18) for the stable state. The distribution of the sample
structure in conformational space demonstrates that the mutation alters Lsd18’s sampling
trend. The T189M mutation emerges as one stable region and two metastable regions in
the conformational space, and the stable structure of Lsd18 is more widely dispersed in
the space, improving the stability of the system. The stability of the system is obviously
improved by the S195M mutation, and the captured structure is almost stable in one
conformation. The structural stability of the double-mutation system is lower than the
S195M mutation system but higher than the T189M mutation system. These results revealed
that the mutation could alter the stability of the Lsd18 structure, as well as its sampling
trend. The T189M mutation can partially stabilize the Lsd18 protein, while the S195M
mutation can improve the structural stability of Lsd18 protein, in contrast to the T189M
and double mutations.
2.5. Crystallography Study of Lsd18-S195M, Lsd18-T189M-S195M
Before the crystallography study, we also performed CD analyses to compare the
secondary structures of Lsd18, Lsd18-T189M, Lsd18-S195M and Lsd18-T189M-S195M. As
shown in Figure 4A,B, no apparent differences in the negative peak were observed, which
indicated that the mutants were as well-structured as the wild-type protein.
In order to reveal the structural basis for the higher thermostability of the best two
mutants, we solved the crystal structures of Lsd18-S195M and Lsd18-T189M-S195M at
the resolution of 2.50 Å and 3.76 Å, respectively. Although the resolution of the second
structure was not high, the secondary structure was clear enough for analysis. Comparing
the structures of Lsd18 WT, Lsd18-S195M, and Lsd18-T189M-S195M, it can be seen that the
angle of the α helix between L408 and T419 shifts, which is in agreement with the MD study.
However, in the crystal structure of Lsd18-S195M, a loop in this region turns to a helix,
indicating the effect of stabilization. Furthermore, the loop region R314-L316, E208-F210
and C398-Q401 in Lsd18 WT change to a β sheet in the two mutants’ crystal structures, also
indicating that this region is less ﬂexible and more stable.
The interactions between M189 and M195 and their surrounding residues are the same
as in the MD analysis. In wild-type Lsd18, there is a hydrogen bonding network between
S195 and D187, S193 and L199. Moreover, weak hydrogen bonds formed between S195 and
L198, as well as Y319. After mutating from S195 to M195, the hydrogen bonds involving
D187 and Y319 were removed and new hydrophobic interactions formed between M195 and
L199, as well as V331. T189 formed hydrogen bonds with D187 and G192. After mutating
to M189, the hydrogen bond with G192 was weakened, while there were hydrophobic
interactions between M189 and L26 as well as P194. More importantly, M189 forms a
hydrogen bond with the cofactor FAD that could stabilize the binding of this cofactor.
Therefore, it is speculated that this could improve the enzymatic activity of this mutant.

3. Discussion
In this study, we utilized FoldX and Rosetta-ddG to predict mutations that increase the
thermostability of Lsd18. The prerequisite for this analysis is our high-resolution structure
of Lsd18 (1.5 Å). The result is that two mutants out of the 12 selected potential mutants
showed relatively signiﬁcant increased thermostability. The successful ratio was 1/6, which
is not very high. However, the underlying mechanisms of the stabilization provide some
hints of this kind of protein engineering. First, the hydrophobic interactions inside the core
of the protein structure might be more important than hydrogen bonds for maintaining the
stability of the protein. Second, for proteins with FAD as the cofactor, strengthening the
interactions between FAD and the protein might further stabilize the whole protein.

Six methods to assess computational methods for predicting protein stability upon
mutation have been compared and evaluated [15]. It is noted that mutations located in β
sheets were more accurately predicted by methods like CC/PBSA, EGAD, I-Mutant2.0, and
Hunter. On the contrary, FoldX and Rosetta demonstrated superior predictive capabilities
for mutations within unstructured regions. Indeed, our most effective mutations, T189M
and S195M, reside within the loop region of Lsd18, in agreement with the above discussion.
The crystal structures of the mutants showed that stabilization could lead to more
rigid enzymes, which might not be beneﬁcial for the activity of the enzyme. However, at a
higher temperature, the mutants could overcome this rigidity and be as catalytically active
as the wild-type enzyme at a lower temperature. Although there is a dilemma between
stability and activity, our example shows that improving the stability of the enzyme could
help mutated enzymes to retain their catalytic activity at a higher temperature. Currently,
at 33 ◦C and after 10 h, Lsd18-T189M could convert 51.3% of the substrate to the product,
highlighting its potential for catalysis by Lsd18. Future efforts aim to optimize this enzyme
further, focusing on enhancing its catalytic efﬁciency and broadening its substrate range.
This optimization could lead to improved enzymatic activity and versatility, opening doors
for diverse applications in biocatalysis.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Rational Design of the Mutants
In preparation for FoldX calculations, the PDB ﬁle of Lsd18 required a critical ad-
justment to reverse the mutation involving the ethylated unnatural amino acid at the
300th position. Subsequently, this modiﬁed structure underwent a meticulous minimiza-
tion process using the RepairPDB function within the FoldX5.0. The essential cfg con-
ﬁguration ﬁle was generated through the ‘prepare4scan.py’ script, available at ‘https:
//github.com/JinyuanSun/DDGScan/tree/master/GUI.’, accessed on 2 November 2021.
This cfg ﬁle contained vital information related to the strategic design of saturation mu-
tations for all residue sites. Finally, we conducted a saturation mutation scan for Lsd18
to obtain ddG (∆∆G) data using PositionScan of FoldX 5.0. All the options were set to
default settings.
To prepare the input structure for Rosetta prediction, all small molecules in the crystal
structure of Lsd18 were removed in PyMOL, and any unreasonable torsions and ligands
were eliminated by utilizing Rosetta’s built-in Python script ‘clean_read’. Subsequently,
effective structural relaxation and energy minimization were performed using the ‘re-
lax.linuxgccrelease’ script, which is compiled with GCC, as provided by the Rosetta pack-
age. The cleaned and relaxed structure serves as the input PDB structure for the Rosetta
ddg monomer mutational scan. To generate all possible mutations, a Python script was
employed to parse the processed amino acids from the PDB ﬁle, creating a ‘mutations.resﬁle’
that corresponds to all twenty amino acid mutations. To expedite the entire mutational scan,
we implemented a parallel computation using ‘mpirun -n 6’, to simultaneously predict the
effects of mutations on six physical CPU cores. The Rosetta monomer ddg module is con-
ﬁgured with ‘ddg_ﬂags’, specifying 50 simulation cycles, while leaving other parameters at
their default settings.
4.2. Site-Directed Mutagenesis of Lsd18
Overlap PCR was performed to obtain all the mutants. For example, to obtain S195M,
ﬁrst, the full length of the gene was used as a template for PCR, with primers of Lsd18-
F-NdeI and S195M-R containing the mutant gene, and primers of Lsd18-R-EcoRI and
S195M-F containing the mutant gene. After the ﬁrst round of PCR, the F-end and R-end
were obtained and further used as the templates for the second round of PCR, which use
Lsd18-R-EcoRI and Lsd18-R-EcoRI as primers to obtain the full length of the gene with
the mutation of S195M. All the genes were inserted into the plasmid of pCold (Takara Bio,
Beijing, China) by the restriction sites of NdeI and EcoRI.
Lsd18 mutagenesis primer design can be found in Table 3.

4.3. Expression and Puriﬁcation of Wild-Type and Mutant Enzymes
The plasmid of lsd18 WT and mutants were co-transformed with the chaperone
plasmid pG-KJE8 (Takara Bio, Beijing, China) into BL21(DE3). The culture was grown in
Luria Broth medium to OD600, reaching 0.6. The production of the protein was induced by
100 µM IPTG, 0.5 mg/mL L-arabinose and 5 ng/mL tetracycline. The culture was incubated
for another 20 h at 15 ◦C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 20 min
at room temperature, resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM
NaCl, pH = 8.0, and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 45 min,
the cleared supernatant was mixed with Ni beads (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China). The
mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 ◦C with moderate shaking and was loaded onto a
column. The beads were washed with a lysis buffer until there was no protein to wash off
and the target protein was eluted with an elution buffer containing 50 mM NaH2PO4, 500
mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH = 8.0. The proteins were further puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration
on a Superdex200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Umeå, Sweden) in 20
mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH = 8.5. The purity of all the proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
4.4. Thermal Shift Assay
The mixture was prepared according to Table 4. Real-Time PCR (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc, Singapore) was applied to record the ﬂuorescent curve with the program of 15 °C
for 5 min and then 85 °C for 30 s with an increment of 1%.

4.5. Trypsin Digestion Assay
The WT and mutants of Lsd18 (0.4 mg/mL) and trypsin (2 µg/mL, Sangon Biotech,
Shanghai, China) were incubated with the buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH = 8.5 and
10 mM CaCl2. After 45 min, 1mM PMSF was added to stop the reaction. The samples were
loaded to SDS-PAGE for further analysis.
4.6. FAD Content Determination
FAD (Sangon Biotech) was dissolved in 20 mM Tris, pH = 8.5, 150 mM NaCl. 5 µM,
10 µM, 50 µM, 80 µM and 100 µM FAD were prepared and the absorbance at 451 nm was
measured to make the standard curve (Figure S2). To measure the FAD content in the Lsd18
protein, the protein sample was heated at 100 ◦C for 10 min and centrifuged at 15,000× g.
The supernatant was collected, and the absorbance was measured at the wavelength at
451 nm.
4.7. The Enzymatic Assay
The buffer system for this assay is 50 mM Tris, pH = 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v)
glycerol. All the reagents were added according to Table 5. The enzymatic assays with
WT and mutants of Lsd18 were performed at 30 ◦C, 33 ◦C, 37 ◦C and 40 ◦C with shaking
at 220 rpm for 10 h. Then, 200 µL ethyl acetate was added to quench the reaction and the
product was extracted to the organic layer. After evaporation, methanol was added to
dissolve the product. The synthetic method used to synthesize this substrate was described
in another manuscript.

4.8. LC-MS Analysis
LC-MS (Agilent 6460 Triple Quad LC/MS, Santa Clara, CA, USA, resolution 0.01 m/z)
was applied with an Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 column at a ﬂow rate of 0.2 mL/min
and column temperature of 30 ◦C. Buffer A was 99.9% H2O and 0.1% formic acid, and
buffer B was 99.9% methanol and 0.1% formic acid. Mass spectra were collected in positive
ion mode 100–1000 m/z. The program was set as shown in Table 6. For the epoxidation
product, peak 508.3+ m/z was selected for analysis. The results are shown in Figure S3.

4.9. CD Analysis
The puriﬁed Lsd18 WT and mutant proteins were diluted to 1 µM and incubated on
ice. The sample was then transferred to the 1 cm glass cuvette and UV (200–500 nm) was
measured by CD spectrometry (J-1500) (Easton, MD, USA).
4.10. Molecular Dynamics Simulations
The initial coordinates were derived from the structure of wild-type Lsd18 protein, The
Lsd18-T189M, Lsd18-S195M and Lsd18-T189M-S195M systems were prepared by mutating
T189M, S195M and T189M-S195M, respectively. All-atom explicit-solvent MD simulations
were performed using the AMBER18 software package [16]. The ff14SB force ﬁeld [17] and
generalized AMBER force ﬁeld (GAFF) [18] were chosen to describe the atomic interactions
of Lsd18 and FAD. All systems were solvated and placed in a cubic box, with a minimal
distance of 10 Å between any system atom and the box wall. Three Na+ were added to
neutralize the systems. To remove the bad contact between initial structures, each system
was initially minimized. After minimization, the systems were heated gradually from 0 to
310 K within 1.0 ns, with a positional restraint of 20.0 kcal/mol·Å2 in protein. This was fol-
lowed by constant-temperature equilibration at 310 K for 1.0 ns, with a positional restraint
of 10.0 kcal/mol·Å2 on protein atoms in a canonical ensemble (NVT). Subsequently, an
equilibration simulation was performed for 1.0 ns at 1 atm and 310 K in the NPT ensemble
with a positional restraint of 4.0 kcal/mol·Å2 on backbone atoms of the protein [19]. The
production MD simulations were carried out at 310 K and 1 atm with a time step of 2.0 fs.
Finally, the 200 ns production simulation was performed on each system.
4.11. X-ray Crystal Structure Determination
To facilitate crystallization, reductive ethylation was performed on Lsd18 protein sam-
ples using a dimethylamine borane complex and acetaldehyde, right before gel ﬁltration.
For Lsd18-T189M-S195M, crystals were obtained from a 1:1 mixture of protein solution
(5.5 mg·mL−1 in 20 mM Tris pH 8.5, 100 mM sodium chloride) and a reservoir solution
(0.2 M Li2SO4, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 30% w/v PEG4000) via the hanging-drop vapor
diffusion method at 18 ◦C. The crystals were transferred into a cryoprotectant containing
20% glycerol, and ﬂash-frozen in liquid nitrogen until X-ray data collection on beamline
BL17B at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Shanghai, China). For Lsd18-S195M,
crystals were obtained from a 1:1 mixture of protein solution (5.5 mg·mL−1 in 20 mM Tris
pH8.5, 100 mM sodium chloride) and a reservoir solution (0.2 M Ammonium acetate, 0.1 M
BIS-TRIS pH 6.5, 25% w/v PEG3350) via the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 18 ◦C.
The crystals were transferred into a cryoprotectant containing 20% glycerol, and ﬂash-
frozen in liquid nitrogen until X-ray data collection on beamline BL18U1 at the Shanghai
Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Shanghai, China).
Data were processed and scaled by HKL2000 [20] and aimless [21] and the structures
were solved by molecular replacement with the program MOLREP [22] using Lsd18-apo
(PDB: 8UP4) as the template. Reﬁnement was performed with Phenix.reﬁne [23] and
Refmac [24] followed by manual examination and rebuilding of the reﬁned coordinates
in the program Coot [25]. Data collection and reﬁnement statistics are summarized in
Table S2.
