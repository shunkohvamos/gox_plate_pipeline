The
optimal
structure
of
synthetic
glycopolymers
for
GM1 mimetics was determined through Bayesian optimization. The
interactions of glycopolymers carrying galactose and neuraminic
acid units in diﬀerent compositions with cholera toxin B subunit
(CTB) were assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA). Gaussian process regression, using the ELISA results, pre-
dicted the composition of glycopolymers that would exhibit stron-
ger interactions with CTB. Following ﬁve cycles of optimization,
the glycopolymers carrying 60 mol% galactose and 25 mol% neur-
aminic acid demonstrated an IC50 value of 75 μM for CTB, repre-
senting the lowest value among the synthesized glycopolymers.
Biomolecules demonstrate their superior functions based on
the precise arrangement of functional groups. In the quest to
develop highly functional molecules, the method of “total syn-
thesis”, involving the construction of complex functional mole-
cules derived from living organisms using simple molecular
structures, has become well-established.1,2 Challenges in the
production or limited supply of naturally derived functional
molecules, especially pharmaceuticals, underscore the signifi-
cance of total synthesis as a crucial approach for artificially
replicating natural compounds. However, due to the intricate
and multi-stage synthetic routes necessary for total synthesis
of natural products, there is an increasing need to explore
simpler synthetic pathways.
When considering the molecular structures of representa-
tive biomolecules like carbohydrates and proteins, the func-
tional expression is typically associated with specific parts of
the
overall
structure.3,4
For
example,
the
structure
of
GM1 ganglioside (Fig. S1†), a natural ligand for cholera toxin,
is notably intricate. However, only two residues, galactose and
Neu5Ac at the terminal ends, are involved in binding to
cholera toxin B subunits (CTB).5,6 Consequently, by focusing
on the parts directly involved in protein binding and mimick-
ing
them
using
diﬀerent
chemical
structures,
synthetic
materials with functionalities similar to natural carbohydrates
can be obtained. This approach is referred to as the “carbo-
hydrate module method” (Fig. 1a).7,8 Our group previously
employed the “carbohydrate module method” in combination
with
synthetic
polymers
to
create
GM1
mimetics.9,10
Glycopolymers carrying both galactose and Nue5Ac units
exhibited strong interactions with CTB. Glycopolymers con-
taining only either carbohydrate exhibited a weak interaction
with CTB, indicating that both galactose and Nue5Ac units
were bound to CTB, as in natural GM1. Furthermore, screening
the interactions of the glycopolymers using surface plasmon
resonance imaging (SPRI) revealed significant variations in
function based on the ratio of galactose units to Nue5Ac units,
indicating the existence of polymer compositions that maxi-
mize the molecular recognition capability.10 However, since

such an exhaustive screening method require ample raw
materials for objective compound evaluation, a more eﬃcient
method is desired for compound searches using rare raw
materials.
Machine learning has emerged as a valuable tool for opti-
mizing materials, with applications reported in various fields
such as drug discovery and catalyst development.11–14 In recent
years, there has been increasing interest in using machine
learning to maximize the functionality of synthetic polymers,
treating monomer units as modules to construct functional
polymers.15,16 For example, Knight and co-workers elucidated
optimal conditions for the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling
reaction with polymer catalysts using statistical analysis and
data visualization.17 However, there have been no examples of
optimizing the functionality of synthetic polymers with mole-
cular recognition capabilities through machine learning. Since
the functions of synthetic copolymers can be customized by
adjusting the monomer ratio, Bayesian optimization emerges
as a suitable machine learning method for understanding the
polymer structure to maximize its functionality.18 The swift
optimization of molecular recognition functionality using
machine learning has the potential to facilitate the develop-
ment of exceptional synthetic inhibitors for unknown targets.
In this work, we treat units of galactose (G) and Neu5Ac (N)
in glycopolymer structures as parameters and aim to maximize
the function of the glycopolymers as GM1 mimics (binding to
CTB) by incorporating machine learning with minimal trial
attempts (Fig. 1b). G and N are integral parts of the natural
ligand for CTB (GM1), and their simultaneous binding to CTB
is crucial for a strong interaction. While a ratio of G : N = 1 : 1
appears to be the most eﬃcient when synthesizing small mole-
cules that mimic GM1, this is not optimal for polymers.
Synthetic polymers adopt various conformations influenced by
the steric hindrance of their side chains and their aﬃnity for
solvents (such as water). Thus, even if the carbohydrate units
are introduced at a G : N = 1 : 1 ratio, the polymer conformation
may not always be ideal for binding to CTB. There exists an
ideal composition in which the glycopolymer can eﬀectively
display G and N for CTB binding, determined by the ratio of
carbohydrate units to each other and the carbohydrate unit
density in the polymer structure.19–21 To control the carbo-
hydrate unit density, N,N-dimethylacrylamide (D) was intro-
duced as the third monomer. Among monomers that are inert
to molecular recognition, hydrophilic, and oﬀer minimal
steric hindrance, D was chosen due to its ease of control
during radical polymerization. To determine the optimal
polymer structure for binding with CTB, we employed a
Bayesian optimization method utilizing Gaussian process
regression.22 In this approach, contours are drawn by provid-
ing outputs for several variables (e.g., Fig. 2). Confidence inter-
vals are also established using the upper confidence bound
algorithm. Vertical cuts of the data are then taken perpendicu-
lar to the axis variables passing through the maximum points
(e.g., Fig. S19–S23†). The point of the variables giving the
highest value within this confidence interval is then evaluated.
In this study, two variables were introduced for Bayesian esti-
mation: the ratio of carbohydrate units to each other (x = [G]/
([G] + [N])) and the ratio of carbohydrate units within the
whole polymer structure (y = ([G] + [N])/([G] + [N] + [D])). The
objective function here is the absorbance obtained in an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, and the
aim is to minimize its value (maximize the interaction). To
cover the range of these variables with as few points as poss-
ible, the first five points were determined using these variables

under
ambient conditions, such as at room temperature and in the
presence of oxygen. These features are suitable for preparation
of a copolymer library. The monomer concentration [M] was
fixed at 0.5 M. The monomer, RAFT agent, photocatalyst
(eosin Y), and reducing agent (ascorbic acid) were mixed at a
ratio of 100 : 1 : 0.01 : 1 in Milli-Q water (200 µL). Each mixture
was added to a 96-well plate and irradiated with LED light (λ =
527 nm) for 3 h at room temperature. The monomer conver-
sions and molecular weights were determined by proton
nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and size exclusion
chromatography (SEC) analysis, respectively (Table 1, 1st
cycle). The monomer conversions were over 90%, and the
polymerization proceeded successfully. The dispersities of the
glycopolymers were narrow (Mw/Mn < 1.12), indicating the
good control in the polymerization.
The interactions of the glycopolymers with CTB was
assessed using ELISA.25 GM1 ganglioside was immobilized on
the bottom of the wells, and mixtures of CTB and each glyco-
polymer were added in the wells. After washing, primary and
secondary antibodies were bound to CTB adsorbed on the
bottom of the wells, and the colorimetric reaction of the tetra-
methylbenzidine substrate by Horseradish peroxidase was
quantified using a plate reader at 450 nm. Among the five gly-
copolymers, G64N16D20 {(x, y) = (0.8, 80)} exhibited the lowest
absorbance, indicating the highest CTB inhibition capability
(Fig. S14†). The absorbance in ELISA of the five glycopolymers
was normalized and applied to Bayesian estimation (Fig. 2a
and Table S1†). In the yellow region, where the carbohydrate
ratio is high and the ratio of galactose units among the total
carbohydrate units is also high, the glycopolymer bound to
CTB more strongly than the other polymers. At this stage, no
local maximal value was predicted. Based on the graph of con-
fidence intervals, a glycopolymer composition that likely to
exhibit stronger interaction {(x, y) = (0.95, 95)} was predicted
(Fig. S19†).
The predicted glycopolymer (G90N5D5) was synthesized, and
their interaction with CTB was assessed by ELISA (Fig. S15†
and Table 1, 2nd cycle). The obtained result was combined
with the results of the previous five glycopolymers, and the
contour lines were redrawn (Fig. 2b and Table S2†). By adding
the results of the 6th point, a local maximal value was
observed. Vertical cuts were made around this maximal value,
and confidence intervals were calculated using Bayesian esti-
mation (Fig. S20†). The location showing the highest ELISA
inhibition eﬀect was chosen as the next exploration point, and
glycopolymers with corresponding compositions were syn-
thesized {(x, y) = (0.7, 70), (0.85, 70), (0.7, 85), and (0.85, 85)}.
The results of ELISA were fed back into the cycle (Fig. S16 and
Table S3†). This process was repeated, and after the 5th cycle,
the point where the highest ELISA result was expected
coincided with the maximum value, thus concluding the
optimization cycle (Fig. 2c–e and Fig. S17, S18, S21–S23,
Tables S4, S5†). Through this process, optimization of the gly-
copolymer structure was achieved by synthesizing a total of 12
polymer samples over five cycles. The composition of the gly-
copolymer at the maximum value was determined to be
G60N25D15, which was shown in the 3rd cycle. The 4th and 5th
cycles further improved its reliability. When we previously ana-
lyzed the interactions of glycopolymers presenting galactose
and Neu5Ac with CTB in a high throughput screening method,
the optimal polymer structure was determined by SPRI
measurements using 28 types of glycopolymers
carrying
diﬀerent ratios of the carbohydrate units. The optimal polymer
was found to be carrying 70 mol% of galactose and 20 mol%
of Neu5Ac.10 In contrast, the Bayesian optimization in this
study determined the optimal polymer structure by repeatedly
evaluating the interactions of the glycopolymers and making

predictions for the better structures based on that evaluation.
The optimization started with 5 types of the polymer samples,
and finally, the optimal structure was determined with 12
types of the glycopolymers. Although the number of total
polymer samples in the Bayesian optimization were smaller
than that in the high throughput screening, both methods
arrived at the optimal glycopolymer structures with the similar
compositions. These compositions featured high carbohydrate
ratios, with galactose being more abundant than Neu5Ac.
These results indicate that the Bayesian optimization can serve
as an alternative method to the high throughput screening for
determining optimal polymer structures with biomolecular
recognition.
To quantify the interaction between the optimized polymer
structure and CTB, ELISA with varying concentrations were
performed to determine the IC50 values (Fig. 3). The optimized
structure G60N25D15 exhibited an IC50 value of 75 μM, which is
7 times lower than that presenting lower amount of Neu5Ac
(G60N10D30, IC50 = 540 μM). This result indicates that even a
15 mol% diﬀerence in the polymer composition of Neu5Ac
leads to a significant diﬀerence in the biomolecular function,
and the Bayesian optimization allowed identification the corre-
lation between the polymer structure and function. This
clearly
demonstrates
the
ability
to
determine
synthetic
polymer structures with superior functionality using Bayesian
estimation. Although the interaction of the optimized glycopo-
lymer with CTB is still 1000 times weaker than that of GM1 (an
IC50 value of GM1 for CTB inhibition is 80 nM),25 further
development of synthetic materials comparable to natural
ones is expected through the design of polymer structures in
the future.
In conclusion, using the concept of the “carbohydrate
module method” to mimic GM1, we performed Bayesian
optimization to determine the optimal structure of glycopoly-
mer that strongly binds to CTB. When conducting Gaussian
process regression, we used the ratio of carbohydrate units to
each other as the x-axis and the overall ratio of galactose and
Neu5Ac side chains in the polymer as the y-axis. Initially, five
diﬀerent compositions of glycopolymers were synthesized via
PET-RAFT polymerization to cover the entire range of polymer
compositions. Upon performing Gaussian process regression
with the ELISA results, no local maximal value was observed,
prompting the addition of another composition combination
around the maximum value in the second cycle. In the third
cycle, a point where the interaction reached a maximum was
identified, and the fourth and fifth cycles further improved its
reliability. In total, five cycles were conducted, resulting in the
synthesis of 12 diﬀerent polymers. The polymer with the opti-
mized structure obtained through this method exhibited an
IC50 value of 75 μM for CTB inhibition, which was lower than
that of the non-optimized glycopolymer. This study represents
the first example of Bayesian optimization of the functionality
of synthetic polymers with monomer unit structures as vari-
ables for molecular recognition, contributing to the develop-
ment of functional polymers using machine learning that is
expected to evolve in the future. Expanding the scope to
include primary structure aspects like monomer sequence and
stereoregularity would open new avenues for exploration.
