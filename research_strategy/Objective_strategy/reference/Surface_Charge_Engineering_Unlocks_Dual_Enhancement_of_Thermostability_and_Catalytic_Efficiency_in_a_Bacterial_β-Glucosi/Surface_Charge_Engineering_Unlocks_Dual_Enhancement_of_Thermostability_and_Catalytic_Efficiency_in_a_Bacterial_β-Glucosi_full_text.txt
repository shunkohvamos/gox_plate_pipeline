ABSTRACT: Resveratrol production via enzymatic hydrolysis of polydatin is hindered by the thermal instability of β-glucosidases.
This study employed rational design to engineer Bacillus sp. D1-derived BglD2 through surface charge optimization. The D156E
mutant achieved a 42.7% increase in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km = 49.76 s−1·mM−1) toward polydatin and a 2.1-fold longer half-life
at 40 °C. The D411E mutant exhibited a 5.2-fold improvement in thermostability while retaining native activity. Structural analyses
revealed that D156E formed a stabilizing salt bridge (2.7 Å) with Lys111 and a hydrogen bond with Pro112, while D411E
established compensatory hydrogen bonds with Phe408. Both mutants maintained broad pH activity (pH 6.0−7.0), high glucose
tolerance (Ki > 55 mM), and metal ion resilience. This work demonstrates that targeted surface charge engineering concurrently
enhances thermostability and catalytic efficiency, enabling efficient resveratrol production with reduced enzyme consumption in
industrial applications.

1. INTRODUCTION
Resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxystilbene, C14H12O3), a naturally
occurring polyphenolic compound, has garnered significant
attention due to its diverse biological activities, including
antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, anticancer, and
cardioprotective properties.1−7 It is widely distributed in plants
such as grapes, Polygonum cuspidatum, and Cassia seeds,
primarily existing as glycosides (e.g., polydatin).1,8 Hydrolysis
of these glycosides by β-glucosidases (BGLs, EC 3.2.1.21)
offers an eco-friendly and efficient approach to produce free
resveratrol.9,10 However, conventional chemical synthesis
methods face challenges such as complex processes, environ-
mental pollution, and low yield,11−13 while direct extraction
from plants is hindered by low resveratrol content and
cumbersome purification.14,15 Quantitative analyses confirm
enzymatic hydrolysis achieves 2.40% resveratrol yield from P.
cuspidatumdouble the 1.20% yield of solvent extraction
methods.11 This 100% improvement validates the efficiency
advantage over chemical synthesis (<0.5% yield).12 Con-
sequently, enzymatic hydrolysis using BGLs has emerged as a
promising strategy for industrial-scale resveratrol production.
BGLs catalyze the cleavage of β-1,4-glycosidic bonds in
glycosides, releasing glucose and bioactive aglycones. These
enzymes are classified into glycoside hydrolase (GH) families
1, 3, 5, 9, 30, and 116 based on sequence and structural
homology.16,17 Their catalytic mechanisms involve either
retaining or inverting configurations, with GH1 and GH3
families predominantly adopting a retaining mechanism via a
two-step process.18−20 Despite their critical role, industrial
application of BGLs is often limited by poor thermostability,
especially under prolonged high-temperature conditions.21,22
Thermal instability leads to rapid activity loss, increased
production costs, and inefficiency in continuous processes.23,24
Enhancing thermostability while maintaining catalytic effi-
ciency and substrate specificity remains a major challenge.
Directed evolution has proven effective in enhancing enzyme
performance. Rational design strategiesguided by structural
insights (e.g., B-factor analysis, molecular dynamics)enable
targeted stabilization of flexible regions or catalytic do-
mains.25−27 For example, introducing disulfide bonds or
optimizing surface charge networks has improved thermo-
stability in multiple GH family enzymes.28,29 Semirational
approaches, such as site-saturation mutagenesis of conserved
catalytic residues, further refine activity and substrate
specificity.30−32 Recent advances in high-throughput screening
(e.g., double-layer Petri-dish assays) accelerate mutant
identification by coupling enzymatic activity with thermal
stress resistance.33−35 The marine bacterial BglD2 from
Bacillus sp. D1 exhibits high glucose tolerance and catalytic
efficiency in hydrolyzing polydatin to resveratrol.36 However,
its suboptimal thermostability at elevated temperatures hinders
industrial scalability.

In this study, we employed rational design to engineer
BglD2 for enhanced thermostability. Potential mutation sites
were identified through amino acid composition analysis,
homology modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations.37−40
Mutants were constructed via site-directed mutagenesis and
evaluated for thermal stability, catalytic activity, and substrate
specificity. Furthermore, the effects of pH, metal ions, and
glucose concentration on enzyme performance were system-
atically investigated. This work provides a robust BGL variant
with improved industrial applicability. The 60% reduction in
enzyme consumptionquantified through half-life extensions
and reactor modelingdemonstrates tangible industrial
sustainability, reducing operational costs while maintaining
high catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km up to 49.76 s−1·mM−1).
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Rational Design of BglD2Mutants. The rational design of
BglD2 mutants aimed to enhance thermostability through structural
bioinformatics and interaction optimization. Key steps included:
Amino acid composition and surface analysis: the BglD2 sequence
(GenBank: MT815914) was analyzed using BioXM and compared to
thermostable bacterial proteins. Amino acid preferences were cross-
validated against ThermoDB’s data set of 1240 thermophilic enzymes
(sequence identity >30%) and PDB_Therm’s structural repository,
confirming D/N/W/Y reduction trends in thermophiles relative to
mesophilic counterparts. Surface-exposed residues (D, N, W, Y) were
targeted for substitution with charged residues (E, K, R), while
internal residues were mutated to hydrophobic variants (e.g., V) to
improve core packing. Surface accessibility was predicted using
NetSurfP-3.0. Internal substitutions (D/N →V) were evaluated
computationally but excluded from experimental validation due to
predicted disruption of hydrogen-bonding networks critical for
structural integrity. Surface charge optimization was prioritized as a
lower-risk strategy with established success in glycosidase thermo-
stabilization.21
Conservation and structural validation: homologous BGL sequen-
ces (e.g., Thermotoga maritima Q08638) were aligned via ClustalW/
ESPript 3.0 to exclude conserved residues. The homology model of
BglD2 was generated using Swiss-Model with PDB 6wiu (Thermotoga
maritima β-glucosidase) as the structural template, achieving robust
quality metrics (GMQE (Global Model Quality Estimate) = 0.91,
QMEAN (Qualitative Model Energy ANalysis) = −0.83). Template
prioritization integrated sequence identity (>45%), structural
resolution (<2.0 Å), and catalytic residue conservation, with PDB
6wiu demonstrating optimal compatibility for BglD2’s substrate
recognition mechanism (Table S1). Specifically, 6wiu achieved 48.7%
sequence identity and 1.8 Å resolution, while fully resolving the
substrate-binding loop (residues 110−120) essential for polydatin
access. Subsequent validation via Ramachandran analysis (90.1%
favored regions), MolProbity (clashscore = 7.22), and ERRAT (89.5)
confirmed stereochemical integrity and structural reliability for
rational engineering.
Active site protection and mutation filtering: molecular docking
(Schrödinger-Maestro) identified substrate-binding residues within 5
Å of polydatin’s glucoside moiety (docking score threshold < −6.0
kcal/mol), which were excluded from mutagenesis to preserve
catalytic integrity, with Glu163/Glu351 automatically protected as
catalytic triad residues per Schrödinger-Maestro default settings. SIFT
predicted deleterious mutations (tolerance index <0.05). B-factor
analysis via SwissModel identified high-flexibility loops (B > 80 Å2)
surrounding residues 110−120 and 405−415. This guided prioritiza-
tion of D156 and D411both in dynamic regionsfor charge
optimization to restrict conformational entropy. PyMOL further
analyzed stabilizing interactions (e.g., salt bridges, π−π stacking).
Ten mutations (N430E, N391 K/R, N329R, N232R, W44R,
D156E, D411E, Y367E, Y268R) were selected for experimental
validation.
2.2. Materials. The BglD2 gene (GenBank: MT815914) from
marine Bacillus sp. D1 was codon-optimized for Escherichia coli
expression using the OPTIMIZER platform and cloned into the pET-
22b (+) vector (Novagen, DE) for recombinant expression. E. coli
DH5α and BL21(DE3) competent cells were prepared in-house.
Restriction enzymes, KOD-Plus-Neo DNA polymerase, and Exnase II
recombination enzyme were purchased from TOYOBO and Nanjing
Novizan Biotechnology. The Ni-NTA affinity chromatography resin
and desalting columns were obtained from Tiandirenhe Biotechnol-
ogy. The BCA protein assay kit and SDS-PAGE rapid staining
reagents were supplied by Nanjing Novizan Biotechnology. Substrates
p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) and polydatin (≥95%
purity) were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China) and
Shanghai Yuanye Biotechnology, respectively. Ni-NTA affinity
chromatography resin and desalting columns were obtained from

Tiandirenhe Biotechnology (Hangzhou, China). All other chemicals,
including LB medium components, imidazole, and metal salts, were of
analytical grade and sourced from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.,
Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
2.3. Strains and Plasmid Construction. The wild-type BglD2
gene was synthesized and inserted into the pET-22b (+) vector via
NdeI/XhoI restriction sites. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed
using the homologous recombination method. Primers for mutations
(N430E, N391 K, N391R, N329R, N232R, W44R, D156E, D411E,
Y367E, Y268R) were designed with 15−21 bp overlapping regions
flanking the mutation sites (Table 1) and synthesized by Hangzhou
Youkang Biotechnology. PCR amplification was carried out using
KOD-Plus-Neo polymerase under the following conditions: initial
denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, annealing
at primer-specific Tm for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 4 min.
Amplified products were digested with DpnI to remove template
plasmids, followed by Exnase II-mediated circularization. The
recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli DH5α for
sequencing verification.
2.4. Protein Expression and Purification. Recombinant E. coli
BL21(DE3) strains harboring wild-type or mutant plasmids were
cultured in LB medium (50 μg/mL ampicillin) at 37 °C until OD600
reached 0.6−0.8. Protein expression was induced with 0.2 mM
isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 16 °C for 16 h.
Cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000g, 5 min) and
resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10
mM imidazole, pH 8.0). After ultrasonication (20 min, 1.5 s pulse/3 s
pause), the lysate was centrifuged (12,000g, 30 min), and the
supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane. Purification
was performed using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography with stepwise
elution (10 mM, 20 mM, and 250 mM imidazole). The eluted
proteins were analyzed by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to confirm purity and molecular
weight. Target protein fractions exhibiting >95% homogeneity (single
band near 50 kDa) were pooled, desalted into citrate-phosphate buffer
(pH 6.5), and quantified via the BCA method.
2.5. Enzyme Activity Assays. The β-glucosidase activity was
determined using pNPG and polydatin as substrates. For pNPG
hydrolysis, the reaction mixture (500 μL) contained 25 μL of 0.1 M
pNPG, 25 μL of diluted enzyme, and 450 μL citrate-phosphate buffer
(pH 6.5). After incubation at 45 °C for 5 min, the reaction was
terminated with 500 μL of 1 M Na2CO3. The released p-nitrophenol
(pNP) was measured at 405 nm. One unit (U) of enzyme activity was
defined as the amount of enzyme releasing 1 μmol pNP per minute.
For polydatin hydrolysis, the reaction system (500 μL) included 25
μL of 0.1 M polydatin, 25 μL enzyme, and 450 μL citrate-phosphate
buffer (pH 6.5). After 5 min at 45 °C, the reaction was stopped with
500 μL ethanol. Resveratrol production was quantified by HPLC

(Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse Plus-C18 column, 303 nm detection, 6:4
water/methanol mobile phase, 1 mL/min flow rate). Enzyme activity
was defined as the amount of enzyme producing 1 μmol resveratrol
per second. For kinetic assays, enzyme concentrations were
standardized to 0.2 mg/mL (final concentration) in all reactions.
2.6. Thermostability and Kinetic Analysis. Thermal inactiva-
tion kinetics were assessed by incubating enzymes (0.2 mg/mL) at 40
or 45 °C in citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). Aliquots (25 μL) were
withdrawn at 10 min intervals, immediately chilled on ice for 2 min,
and assayed for residual activity using 0.1 M pNPG (25 μL) as the
substrate at 45 °C. The reaction was terminated with 500 μL of 1 M
Na2CO3 after 5 min and released p-nitrophenol was quantified at 405
nm. The first-order inactivation model was applied

The half-inactivation temperature (T50

incubating enzymes at 35−50 °C (2.5 °C intervals) for 10 min,
followed by residual activity measurement. Data were fitted to a
sigmoidal Boltzmann model using GraphPad Prism 8.0.
For kinetic analysis under thermal stress, mutants (e.g., D156E,
D411E) were preincubated at 45 °C for 0−60 min, then equilibrated
to 45 °C for 2 min prior to assay initiation. Polydatin hydrolysis was
performed with substrate concentrations of 0.02−1.0 mM. Initial
velocities were derived from linear resveratrol production (0−3 min),

2.7. pH and Metal Ion Effects. The pH stability was evaluated by
preincubating enzymes in buffers (pH 4.5−7.0) at 4 °C for 12 h.
Residual activity was measured under standard conditions. For metal
ion effects, enzymes were assayed in the presence of 1 mM or 5 mM
Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, or Zn2+.
2.8. Glucose Tolerance. Glucose inhibition constants (Ki) were
determined using polydatin (0.02−1.0 mM) as the substrate with 0.1
mM or 1.0 mM glucose. Data were analyzed via competitive
inhibition models in GraphPad Prism.
2.9. Statistical Analysis. All experiments were performed in
triplicate. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Significance was assessed using Student’s t-test (P < 0.05).
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Rational Design Unlocks Synergistic Stabilization
Mechanisms in BglD2. Our systematic analysis of the amino acid
composition of BglD2 revealed critical disparities between its
sequence and that of thermophilic homologues (Figure 1a).
Surface-exposed residues D, N, W, and Y were overrepresented
(22−24% vs 12−15% in thermophiles), consistent with prior
observations that thermophilic proteins exhibit distinct amino acid
preferences compared to mesophilic counterparts,41 suggesting
suboptimal electrostatic interactions. By contrast, internal regions
exhibited excessive hydrophilicity (e.g., 18% polar residues vs 8−10%
in thermophiles), a feature known to potentially destabilize the
hydrophobic core critical for thermostability,42,43 likely destabilizing
the hydrophobic core. These findings guided our mutation strategy:
surface substitutions (D →E, N →K/R, W/Y →R) to enhance
charge complementarity and potentially form stabilizing salt bridges
or hydrogen bonds,44,45 and internal substitutions (D/N →V, W/Y
→L) to reinforce hydrophobic packing and improve core stability43,46
(Table 2).
Through a multitier computational pipeline (Figure 1), 102
candidate sites identified via amino acid composition analysis were
systematically filtered to 10 high-priority mutations. First, NetSurfP-
3.0 surface accessibility profiling (Table 2) and multisequence
alignment (Figure 1b) excluded 47 conserved residues (e.g., catalytic
motifs Glu163/Glu351), validating their essential role in catalysis and
justifying their exclusion from mutagenesis.47 This reduced the
candidate pool to 55 sites. Template prioritization considered
sequence identity, structural resolution, and functional conservation.
PDB 6wiu outperformed other GH family structures in all metrics
(Table S1), particularly in substrate-binding loop completeness
critical for rational design. Homology modeling (GMQE = 0.91,
QMEAN = −0.83) and molecular docking revealed that 9/54
candidate mutations resided within 5 Å of the substrate-binding
pocket (Figures 1c and S1). For instance, W44R, located near the
catalytic triad, was discarded to avoid steric clashes. SIFT analysis
further eliminated 5 mutations (e.g., D34E, N245 K) which were
predicted to disrupt folding (tolerance index <0.05), resulting in 49
candidates. Finally, PyMOL interaction analysis identified 10
mutations (N430E, N391 K, N391R, N329R, N232R, W44R,
D156E, D411E, Y367E and Y268R) that were predicted to form
new salt bridges or hydrogen bonds, which are known to contribute to
protein thermostability43,44 (Figures 1d and S2). These computational
predictions closely aligned with the experimental outcomes.

screening with the synthetic substrate pNPG at 45 °C identified
D156E as a standout mutant, exhibiting 1.43-fold higher specific
activity (304.44 ± 3.25 U/mg) than the wild-type BglD2 (213.20 ±
1.84 U/mg), while the D411E mutant demonstrated significantly
enhanced thermostability with a 5.22-fold extended half-life at 40 °C
(51 min vs WT 10 min) (Table 3). The mutants N232R, N329R,
Y268R, and W44R exhibited severe activity impairment (≤30%
relative activity) and were discarded. Crucially, all six retained
mutants shared an identical optimum temperature (Tm = 45 °C),
indicating that the mutations did not perturb the fundamental thermal
unfolding profile (Figure 2a). This preservation of Tm suggests that
the mutations primarily stabilize the folded state without dramatically
altering the global unfolding pathway.48 Thermal stability profiling
revealed divergent behaviors: at 45 °C, D411E exhibited superior
residual activity (48.52 ± 1.53% after 10 min) compared to WT
(36.56 ± 1.04%) and D156E (41.97 ± 1.90%) (Figure 2b), whereas
at 40 °C, D411E demonstrated the most pronounced stability
enhancement while D156E showed balanced improvement in both
activity and stability (T(1/2,40°C) = 20.85 ± 0.51 min, 2.15-fold
increase). Notably, Y367E displayed compromised thermostability
(T(1/2,40°C) = 4.58 ± 0.44 min) despite moderate activity gain (234.12
U/mg), emphasizing the critical, site-dependent influence of mutation
selection on stability outcomes,49 highlighting the critical influence of
mutation site selection.
The synergistic enhancement of both catalytic efficiency and
thermostability in D156E and D411E contrasts with typical stability−
activity trade-offs in glycosidase engineering. This unexpected synergy
likely stems from their strategic localization: The D156E mutation
enables formation of a stable 2.7 Å salt bridge with Lys111 and a
hydrogen bond (2.7 Å) with Pro112, collectively rigidifying a flexible
surface loop. Salt bridges are well-established contributors to protein
thermostability, with shorter distances often correlating with greater
stability.44,50 And the D411E mutation establishes two hydrogen
bonds (2.6 Å and 2.7 Å) with Phe408 near the substrate cleft
periphery without interfering with catalytic residues (Glu163/
Glu351). Hydrogen bonding networks, particularly those involving
aromatic residues like Phe, are also recognized stabilizers.43 These
structural modifications rationalize D411E’s dominant thermal
resilience and the dual optimization of D156E, validating the rational
design strategy targeting solvent-accessible residues distant from the
active site. Furthermore, the D156E/D411E variants align with GRAS
(Generally Recognized As Safe) criteria for food-grade enzymes:
expression in the nonpathogenic host E. coli BL21(DE3), absence of
toxic byproducts, and resilience under industrial processing conditions
(pH 6.0−7.0, ≤45 °C). This positions them as robust biocatalysts for
resveratrol-enriched functional foods compliant with FDA safety
standards. Consequently, D156E and D411E were advanced for
natural substrate validation.

3.3. Performance with Natural Substrate Polydatin. Temper-
ature profiling confirmed that both the D156E and D411E variants
maintained an identical temperature optimum (45 °C) to the wild-
type enzyme when hydrolyzing polydatin (Figure 3a). Notably,
D156E exhibited significantly enhanced activity (≥85% of maximum)
across a broader temperature range (35−50 °C) compared to WT
(40−48 °C), indicating improved structural rigidity and resistance to
thermal unfolding.51 The broadening of functional temperature
window highlights the thermoadaptive effect of surface charge
optimization. The complete conversion of polydatin to resveratrol
was confirmed by HPLC analysis (Figure S4), showing the
disappearance of the polydatin peak (5.6 min) and appearance of
the resveratrol peak (8.2 min). When using polydatin (a resveratrol
precursor), the specific activity of D156E and D411E increased by
1.38-fold (to 126.81 U/mg) and 1.18-fold (to 108.03 U/mg),
respectively (Table 4). Both mutants doubled T1/2 at 40 °C (56.81−
57.89 min vs WT 27.41 min) (Figure 3b) and increased the T50
10
value by 0.26−1.15 °C (Figure 3c), a key parameter indicating higher
thermal denaturation resistance.51,52 The 2.1-fold extended half-life
(T1/2,40 °C = 57.89 min for D156E mutant) enables continuous
reactor operation for >5 h with <50% activity loss. This reduces
enzyme replenishment frequency by 60% compared to wild-type
(calculated from T1/2 ratios: 1 - [27.41/57.89] × 100% ≈60%),
significantly lowering operational costs. Michaelis−Menten analysis
revealed enhanced catalytic efficiency: D156E reduced Km by 7%
(0.14 mM) and increased kcat/Km by 42.7% (49.76 s−1̇·mM−1) versus
WT (Figure 3d). The reduction in Km suggests potentially improved
substrate binding affinity,53 while the significant increase in kcat/Km
reflects enhanced catalytic efficiency. This improvement correlates
with the formation of a 2.7 Å salt bridge with Lys111 and a hydrogen
bond with Pro112, collectively rigidifying the β-hairpin loop and
facilitating transition-state stabilization.
3.4. Biochemical Characterization of D156E and D411E. pH
profiling showed optimal activity at pH 6.5 for all enzymes (Figure
4a). Stability after 12 h at 4 °C was >80% in pH 6.0−7.0 but dropped
sharply below pH 5.5 (Figure 4b), a pattern consistent with many β-
glucosidases that exhibit optimal stability near neutral pH.54 The
effects of metal ions were consistent: Cu2+, Fe2+, Fe3+ and Mn2+
inhibited activity (e.g., 5 mM Fe3+ reduced activity to 77−80% of the
control level), which is consistent with reports of these ions inhibiting
various BGLs.54,55 Meanwhile, Ca2+ and Mg2+ (5 mM) enhanced
activity by 6−15% (Table 5). Glucose tolerance was retained: The Ki
values for glucose were 55.79 ± 4.95 mM (D156E), 85.60 ± 10.01
mM (D411E) and 64.33 ± 7.04 mM (wild type) (Figure 4c), which
confirms that the mutants retained the strong glucose tolerance
characteristic of BglD2. The mutants’ resilience to metal ions (Table
5) and EDTA suggests compatibility with crude plant extracts
containing inhibitory compounds. While direct biomass hydrolysis
was not performed, the high glucose tolerance (Ki > 55 mM) and
thermostability align with industrial BGLs operating in lignocellulosic
hydrolysates.56 The engineered variants’ extended functional range
(35−50 °C) and prolonged half-life enable continuous processing
under industrial thermal fluctuations. Retention of >85% activity at 50
°C permits integration with upstream thermal pretreatment phases,

with its loop-stabilizing salt bridge and hydrogen bond. Error bars represent mean ± SD from three independent experiments.

reducing cooling energy demands by ≥30%. This is a valuable trait
for lignocellulose hydrolysis, where glucose accumulation is
common.54,57
3.5. Structural Basis for Enhanced Thermostability in D156E
and D411E Mutants. Surface-charge engineering exhibits critical
distinctions from conventional stabilization approaches. Disulfide
bond introductionexemplified in Trichoderma reesei xylanase
enhances thermostability through covalent cross-links but risks
catalytic impairment in prokaryotic systems due to redox sensitivity.58
In contrast, the D411E mutation achieves commensurate stability
gains (T1/2,40°C = 51 min, 5.2-fold increase over wild-type) via
compensatory hydrogen bonds (2.6 Å and 2.7 Å) with Phe408,
without perturbing the reducing cytoplasm of E. coli BL21(DE3).
Similarly, glycosylation-mediated stabilization necessitates eukaryotic
post-translational machinery, rendering it incompatible with bacterial
hosts.59 Our method exploits electrostatic reconfiguration of solvent-
accessible residues (e.g., D156E’s 2.7 Å salt bridge with Lys111 and
shortened hydrogen bond with Pro112) to concurrently enhance
thermostability (T50
10 increase of 1.15 °C) and catalytic efficiency
(kcat/Km = 49.76 s−1·mM−1, 42.7% gain over wild-type), a dual
enhancement rarely achieved through disulfide or glycosylation
engineering (Table S2).
Based on computational analyses, we hypothesize that the
thermostability enhancements in D156E and D411E arise from
distinct electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding networks. While these
models align with experimental data, direct structural validation is
required to confirm these mechanisms. Comparative structural
analyses reveal distinct yet complementary mechanisms underlying

the enhancement of thermostability in the D156E and D411E
mutants, while preserving catalytic function. In the D156E mutant,
substituting aspartate with glutamate elongates the side chain by 1.3
Å, enabling a dual-anchor stabilization mechanism. The carboxylate
group of Glu156 forms a 2.7 Å salt bridge with Lys111
strengthening electrostatic attraction compared to the longer 2.9 Å
Asp156·Lys111 interaction in wild-type (WT), as shorter salt bridges
are generally more stabilizing.44,50 Concurrently, Glu156 establishes a
shorter hydrogen bond (2.7 Å vs WT 2.9 Å) with Pro112’s backbone
carbonyl, rigidifying the β-hairpin loop (residues 110−120). This
synergistic restraint reduces conformational entropy, a major factor in
thermal unfolding, directly explaining the 2.1-fold extended half-life at
40 °C and broadened temperature adaptability (≥85% activity from
35 to 50 °C vs WT 40−48 °C). Crucially, these interactions occur
distal to the catalytic triad (Glu163/Glu351), preserving substrate
binding geometry and enabling a 42.7% increase in kcat/Km for
polydatin hydrolysis.
The D411E mutant employs an alternative stabilization strategy.
Glutamate substitution at position 411 increases the distance to
Lys412 from 2.5 Å in WT to 3.2 Å, suggesting attenuation of the
primary electrostatic pair. Compensatory stabilization arises through
two new hydrogen bonds formed between Glu411 and Phe408 (2.6 Å
and 2.7 Å), immobilizing this hydrophobic residue adjacent to the
substrate-binding pocket. Hydrogen bonds to aromatic side chains
like Phe can provide significant stabilization energy.43 This structural
rearrangement restricts unfolding initiation, potentially by stabilizing a
key folding nucleus,48 which accounts for the exceptional 5.2-fold
longer half-life of D411E at 40 °C, despite maintained substrate
affinity (Km comparable to WT). The D411E substitution illustrates
how targeted charge optimization can overcome classical stability−
activity trade-offs. Although the salt bridge to Lys412 weakens
(Δdistance = +0.7 Å), compensatory hydrogen bonding with Phe408
rigidifies the hydrophobic core, suppressing conformational entropy in
the β7-β8 loop while maintaining catalytic geometry.
These cases demonstrate that strategic surface charge optimiza-
tionvia side chain elongation (D156E) or conformational
repositioning (D411E)mitigates classical stability−activity trade-
offs in glycosidases.60 The engineering implications highlight three
principles: solvent-exposed residues (>40% accessibility) permit
drastic mutations without perturbing catalysis; salt bridge formation
requires precise distance tuning (2.5−3.0 Å) to avoid over-
rigidification;44 and compensatory interactions (e.g., D411E →
Phe408) enable stability gains despite weakened primary electrostatic
pairs, establishing a transferable paradigm for industrial enzyme
thermostabilization.51 The D411E mutant exemplifies how localized
electrostatic attenuation can be counterbalanced by alternative
interactions (e.g., H-bonds to hydrophobic residues), preventing
destabilization of distal regionsa strategy applicable to other
solvent-exposed sites. The proposed mechanisms for D156E (loop
rigidification) and D411E (hydrophobic core stabilization) are
tentative hypotheses derived from computational models. Future
studies using high-resolution structural biology techniques are
essential to validate these interactions. The D156E/D411E variants
thus exemplify rational design leveraging context-dependent electro-
static networks to achieve both stability and activity enhancements.61
