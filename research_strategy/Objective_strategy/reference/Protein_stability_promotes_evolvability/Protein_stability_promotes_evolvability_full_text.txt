The biophysical properties that enable proteins to so readily evolve
to perform diverse biochemical tasks are largely unknown. Here,
we show that a protein’s capacity to evolve is enhanced by the
mutational robustness conferred by extra stability. We use simu-
lations with model lattice proteins to demonstrate how extra
stability increases evolvability by allowing a protein to accept a
wider range of beneﬁcial mutations while still folding to its native
structure. We conﬁrm this view experimentally by mutating mar-
ginally stable and thermostable variants of cytochrome P450 BM3.
Mutants of the stabilized parent were more likely to exhibit new
or improved functions. Only the stabilized P450 parent could
tolerate the highly destabilizing mutations needed to confer novel
activities
such
as
hydroxylating
the
antiinﬂammatory
drug
naproxen. Our work establishes a crucial link between protein
stability and evolution. We show that we can exploit this link to
discover protein functions, and we suggest how natural evolution
might do the same.

iological systems are evolvable in the sense that mutation
and selection are able to create new or improved pheno-
types. A major biological question is how a system’s physical
properties influence its capacity to evolve (1, 2). In recent years,
understanding the determinants of evolvability has also become
an important practical concern as researchers increasingly use
evolution to engineer everything from proteins (3) to designs for
civil engineering structures (4).
Proteins are one of the simplest and best examples of evolvable
biological systems, because they possess biochemical functions
that can be altered with just a few mutations (5). One property
that has been broadly hypothesized to contribute to evolvability
is robustness to mutations (6), and proteins are often quite
mutationally robust, with more than half of the single mutants of
many proteins retaining their native functions (7–10). Because
proteins usually must fold to function, and because mutated
proteins generally adopt the original native structure if they fold
at all (11, 12), retention of the basic native structure is normally
a prerequisite for the acquisition of new functions. Extra ther-
modynamic stability makes a protein’s native structure and
function more robust to random mutations by increasing the
fraction of mutants that continue to possess the minimal stability
required to fold (10, 13).
Here, we investigate how stability affects a protein’s evolv-
ability by using controlled experiments to measure the fraction
of a protein’s mutants that exhibit new or improved function. We
first use a simple computational model to establish a framework
for understanding the relationships among protein stability,
mutational robustness, and evolvability. We then validate this
framework with experiments on members of the biochemically
important cytochrome P450 enzyme family and describe specific
examples that illustrate the biophysical basis of the connection
between protein stability and evolvability. Finally, we discuss the
implications of our work for understanding natural protein
evolution and designing better protein engineering strategies.
Results
Simulations with Model Lattice Proteins. We used a simple concep-
tual framework (10) for understanding the relationship between
protein stability and evolution. The premise is that evolution
selects for a protein’s biochemical function rather than its
stability. However, because a protein’s function typically de-
pends on its ability to fold to a thermodynamically stable native
structure (14), stability is still constrained during evolution.
Specifically, we imagine that a protein must fold to its native
structure with some minimal stability to remain folded at
physiological conditions. If a protein fails to meet this minimal
stability threshold, then it will neither fold nor function. If a
protein does fold with at least the minimal required stability,
then evolution selects for a protein’s function and is indifferent
to the amount of extra stability it possesses. Most proteins,
however, will still be marginally stable, because highly stable
sequences are rare (15).
This conceptual framework formed the basis for simulations
with lattice proteins. Lattice proteins are highly simplified
protein models that are useful tools for studying protein folding
and evolution (16, 17). Our lattice proteins were chains of 20
amino acids that fold on a two-dimensional lattice, with the
energy of each conformation equal to the sum of the pairwise
interactions between nonbonded amino acids (18). Each lattice
protein can occupy any of 41,889,578 possible conformations,
and, by summing over all of these conformations, we could
exactly determine the partition function and free energy of
folding (Gf). We set a minimal stability threshold for our lattice
proteins by requiring them to fold to the original native structure
with a stability of Gf  0 (in no case did we observe a protein
that stably folded to a new structure), which is equivalent to
requiring the native structure to have a lower free energy than
the ensemble of all nonnative conformations. For those proteins
that stably folded, we measured function as the binding energy
of the folded protein to a small rigid ligand (19), as shown in Fig.
1A. Our model, therefore, recapitulated the essential require-
ments imposed on real proteins of simultaneously folding and
performing a biochemical task.
We first evolved a model protein to stably fold and strongly
bind a ligand (Fig. 1A). This evolved protein had a stability of
Gf  0.5, meaning that it was only marginally stable, as is
typical for real proteins (20). We then simulated the process of
directed evolution with two rounds of random mutagenesis by
error-prone PCR and screening to identify a stabilized variant of
our model protein (Gf  1.5) that contained three amino acid
substitutions and exhibited the same ligand-binding energy as the
original protein. To examine the evolvabilities of the original and
stabilized model proteins, we computationally simulated screen-
ing libraries of 1,500 randomly mutated sequences for mutants
that bound to new ligands with at least twice the affinity of the
parent proteins. For all four new ligands we examined, the parent
proteins bound the new ligand with equal affinity, yet, each time,
the mutant library from the stabilized parent produced more
than twice as many unique improved mutants (Fig. 1B).

evolvable. The mutants in both libraries exhibited similar
changes in stability (G values), but the extra stability of the
stabilized protein meant that a larger fraction of its mutants
continued to fold (46% versus 35% among all mutants with at
least one mutation), confirming previous findings that more
stable lattice proteins are more robust to mutations (10, 21).
The improved mutants tended to be destabilized and so were
more frequent in the library from the stabilized parent. Al-
though the more stable parent had a 50% increase in the
fraction of mutants that folded, it had nearly four times more
improved mutants (56 versus 15). The fact that extra stability
increases the number of improved mutants much more than it
increases the number of mutants that retain parental function
indicates that improved mutants tended to be more destabilized
than the typical folded mutant.
Experiments on Cytochrome P450 BM3 Variants. To experimentally
test the effect of stability on the evolvability of real proteins, we
randomly mutated two variants of a cytochrome P450 BM3 (also
known as CYP102A1) heme domain peroxygenase (22) and
screened for mutants with new or improved activity on five
substrates. The cytochrome P450 superfamily contains members
involved in important biochemical processes such as drug me-
tabolism and steroid biosynthesis (23, 24). P450 BM3 catalyzes
subterminal hydroxylation of medium- and long-chain fatty acids
(25). The 21B3 variant is a laboratory-evolved version of the
P450 BM3 heme domain that efficiently hydroxylates 12-p-
nitrophenoxycarboxylic acid (12-pNCA, structure shown in Fig.
2), using hydrogen peroxide in place of the NADPH cofactor and
oxygen (22). The 5H6 variant was created by laboratory evolu-
tion of 21B3, selecting for mutants that were more thermostable
while retaining activity on 12-pNCA (26). We quantified the
stabilities of the enzymes by the temperature (T50) at which half
of the protein irreversibly denatured after a 10-min incubation.
Because denaturation is irreversible, these T50 values are not
equilibrium thermodynamic measurements and so cannot be
directly related to Gf. However, the T50 values were highly
correlated with the stability to irreversible denaturation by urea,
supporting the notion that they reflect universal aspects of
protein stability rather than unique characteristics of the process
of irreversible thermal denaturation (see Supporting Materials
and Methods and Fig. 5, which are published as supporting
information on the PNAS web site). As measured by the T50
values, the 21B3 enzyme is only marginally stable (T50  47°C),
whereas 5H6 is much more stable (T50  62°C) (melting curves
are shown in Fig. 6, which is published as supporting information
on the PNAS web site). The 5H6 enzyme differs from 21B3 at
8 residues (of 464 total). Both variants displayed nearly the same
activity (measured as total turnovers) on 12-pNCA and all other
substrates examined in this work.

We created mutant libraries of both 21B3 and 5H6 using
error-prone PCR. The libraries were generated under identical
conditions and had the same distributions of mutations (Fig. 2).
The overall mutation rate was 4.5  0.3 nucleotide mutations per
gene (Table 1). We examined 522 mutants from each library for
retention of folding, as assayed by the characteristic Soret band
at 450 nm in the carbon monoxide-binding difference spectrum
(27). As expected, mutants of the stabilized 5H6 protein were
more likely than those of the 21B3 protein to fold (61% of 5H6
mutants contained at least half the folded protein of the parent
versus 33% for 21B3, raw data are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 3,
which are published as supporting information on the PNAS web
site). Most of these folded mutants retained at least half the
parental activity on 12-pNCA (94% and 96% for 5H6 and 21B3),
indicating that mutations that disrupted parental function gen-
erally did so by preventing the formation of properly folded
protein, confirming the experimental findings of ref. 10 that
more stable proteins are more robust to mutations.
We examined the evolvability of the 21B3 and 5H6 enzymes
by screening for mutants that hydroxylated any of five new
substrates: the antiinflammatory drug naproxen, 3-phenoxytolu-
ene, phenoxyacetic acid, the -adrenergic receptor blocking
agent propranolol, and 2-methylbenzofuran (structures shown in
Fig. 9, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS
web site). We screened for hydroxylation activity using the
4-aminoantipyrene (4-AAP) assay to measure the total amount
of product after completion of the reaction (28) and determined
that neither 21B3 nor 5H6 had detectable activity on the first
three substrates, both had equal weak activity on propranolol,
and 21B3 had trace activity on 2-methylbenzofuran (Table 2).
We used consistent quantitative criteria to identify mutants that
had either acquired new activity or improved by 50% over the
parental level in the 4-AAP assay. We screened 8,160 mutant–
substrate pairs for each parent. From these pairs, we identified
13 improved mutants of 5H6 and 4 improved mutants of 21B3
(Fig. 3A and Table 2). All of the improved mutants had unique
protein sequences (given in Table 4, which is published as
supporting information on the PNAS web site). Thus, we found

more than three times more improved mutants in the 5H6 library
than in the 21B3 library.
To assess the importance of stability in conferring enhanced
evolvability on the 5H6 protein, we measured the stabilities of all
improved mutants (melting curves are in Fig. 6 ). Fig. 3B shows
that none of the improved 21B3 mutants was destabilized by
3°C but that the thermostable 5H6 parent produced improved
mutants that were destabilized by as much as 14°C. We identified
specific beneficial but destabilizing substitutions that could be
made only in the stabilized parent. For example, neither 21B3
nor 5H6 exhibited activity on naproxen, presumably because the
negatively charged naproxen molecule does not enter the hy-
drophobic P450 BM3 substrate-binding pocket. Mutating
leucine 75 in the substrate-binding pocket to arginine allowed
5H6 to hydroxylate naproxen by providing a compensating
positive charge for the naproxen molecule (Fig. 4). However,
burial of this arginine residue in the hydrophobic binding pocket
substantially destabilized the 5H6 mutant (T50  8°C). When
we made the same substitution to 21B3, we could recover only
inactive and improperly folded protein (as indicated by a carbon
monoxide difference spectrum peak at 420 nm (29), as shown in
Fig. 10, which is published as supporting information on the
PNAS web site). The F275S substitution (located 12 Å from the
substrate) (30) is another example of a beneficial substitution
that could be made only in the stabilized parent. This substitu-
tion conferred 3-phenoxytoluene activity on the 5H6 parent, but
decreased the T50 by 7°C. When we made this substitution in
21B3, we again could not recover any folded protein (see Fig. 11,
which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web
site). In contrast, the F205L substitution (located near the
substrate-binding pocket) (30) found in a 21B3 mutant with
improved activity on propranolol did not have a substantial
effect on stability, and slightly improved the activity of both 21B3
and 5H6 when introduced into those sequences (see Fig. 12,
which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web
site).
Discussion
We have shown that more stable proteins are more evolvable
because they are better able to tolerate functionally beneficial
but destabilizing mutations. Our work touches on the relation-
ship between protein stability and function, which has histori-
cally been a subject of considerable confusion. Despite repeated
speculation to the contrary (31–33), high stability and function
are not inherently incompatible, because a wealth of experiments
have shown that proteins can be dramatically stabilized without
sacrificing their biological functions (34–37). But protein stabil-
ity and function often appear to trade off at the level of
individual mutations. This apparent tradeoff is, at least partly,
because of the simple fact that most randomly chosen mutations
(functionally beneficial or not) are destabilizing (38–41). In
addition, residues in a protein’s active site often must satisfy
functional constraints (such as maintaining buried charges or
cavities in a protein’s interior) that make them poorly optimized
for stability (42–44). Therefore, mutating active-site residues
often enhances stability at the cost of function (42–44), and,
likewise, acquiring new functions can require destabilizing mu-
tations (as is the case for our L75R mutation in P450, which
confers activity on naproxen by burying a positive charge).
However, it remains unclear whether active-site constraints
intensify the tradeoff between stability and functional evolution,
because a seemingly opposite argument can be made that
mutations to an active site that is already poorly optimized for
Fig. 3.
Increased stability enhances evolvability of the P450 BM3 heme
domain. (A) The stable 5H6 protein yielded more mutants with new or
improved activity than the marginally stable 21B3 protein. The counts above
the bars give the number of improved mutants of the total number of mutants
screened. (B) Some of the improved 5H6 mutants were greatly destabilized
relative to the parent protein, whereas the stabilities of the improved 21B3
mutants clustered around those of the parent protein (circles show T50 values
for improved mutants).

stability should be less destabilizing than typical mutations (they
could even enhance stability if, for example, they confer function
on smaller substrates by reducing the size of a cavity in a protein’s
interior). If functionally innovative mutations tend to be more
destabilizing than random mutations, then extra protein stability
should enhance the rate of functional innovation more than it
enhances the mutational robustness of the native function. In our
lattice protein simulations, extra stability increased the rate of
functional innovation by nearly 300%, whereas it increased
mutational robustness by only 50%; however, we feel that our
lattice model is too crude to confidently extrapolate conclusions
involving residue-level properties to real proteins. In our P450
experiments, extra stability also increased the number of func-
tionally improved mutants (from 4 to 13) more than it increased
mutational robustness (by a factor of 1.8); however, here, the
statistics are too poor to conclude that functional innovation is
improved significantly more than mutational robustness. There-
fore, in our minds, it remains unclear whether extra protein
stability promotes evolvability simply by improving the tolerance
to all mutations (some of which happen to be functionally
beneficial) or whether the effect is further amplified by a
tendency for functionally innovative mutations to be especially
destabilizing.
In either case, our work argues, quite generally, that extra
stability will enhance evolvability. Although it is clearly possible
to stabilize proteins without interfering with their functions
(34–37), proteins tend to be only marginally more stable than is
required by their environment (20). This marginal stability is
probably because of the fact that natural selection does not
directly favor extra stability in the face of predominantly desta-
bilizing mutations, causing stability to drift toward the minimum
evolutionary requirement (15, 45). Naturally evolving proteins
must, therefore, wait for functionally neutral mutations to
stabilize the structure to counterbalance the effects of other
destabilizing but functionally beneficial mutations (46). In this
sense, a protein’s stability represents a hidden dimension in
evolution: Extra stability is neutral with respect to selection for
protein function, but it can be crucial in allowing a protein to
tolerate mutations that confer beneficial phenotypes. We have
shown that protein engineering by directed evolution is more
effective if direct selection for extra stability is used to increase
a protein’s evolvability. The extent to which natural evolution
might also select for evolvability has been the subject of much
recent theoretical speculation (2, 6, 47). We suggest that one
possible mechanism by which natural evolution could increase
evolvability would be to stabilize proteins undergoing adaptive
evolution or provide systems to buffer the effects of destabilizing
protein mutations.
Methods
P450 Mutant Libraries. We used error-prone PCR to create
mutant libraries of the marginally stable 21B3 (22) and the
thermostable 5H6 (26) variants of the cytochrome P450 BM3
heme domain. The template DNA was the appropriate gene
cloned into the pCWori (48) plasmid as described in refs. 22
and 26. We confirmed the sequences of the 21B3 and 5H6
genes by sequencing them with the primers pCWorifor (5-
GAAACAGGATCCATCGATGCTTAGGAGGTCAT-3,
pCWorirev (5-GCGTATCACGAGGCCCTTTCGTCT-
TCAAGC-3), and pCWorimidrev (5-CCAGCTTGTGGC-
CAACCCGAC-3). The sequences matched those that were
reported (22, 26), with 21B3 containing 10 amino acid substi-
tutions relative to the wild-type P450 BM3 heme domain
(I58V, F87A, H100R, F107L, A135S, M145V, N239H, S274T,
K434E, and V446I in the numbering scheme, where residue 1
is the threonine after the cleaved N-terminal methionine) and
5H6 containing 8 amino acid substitutions relative to 21B3
(L52I, S106R, V145M, A184V, L324I, V340M, I366V, and
E442K) as well as the removal of one histidine from the
C-terminal His tag.
The error-prone PCRs for the two parents were carried out
in parallel by using identical conditions to ensure the same mutation
rate for both. The reactions were 100 l and contained 13 ng of
template plasmid (corresponding to 3 ng of gene), 0.5 M of the
oligonucleotide primers (pCWorifor and pCWorirevclone, 5-
GCTCATGTTTGACAGCTTATCATCG-3), 200 M dATP and
dGTP, 500 M dTTP and dCTP, 7 mM MgCl2, 200 M MnCl2, 1	
Applied Biosystems PCR Buffer, and 5 units of Taq. PCR condi-
tions were 95°C for 5 min, followed by 16 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s
at 51°C, and 60 s at 72°C. Gel electrophoresis versus a known
standard indicated that this yielded PCR product at a concentration
of 12 ngl, for a PCR efficiency of   0.45. The PCR products
were cloned into pCWori with BamHI and EcoRI, electroporated
into a catalase-free strain of Escherichia coli (48) and plated on LB
plates containing 100 gml ampicillin. Transformation of a control
ligation with no insert indicated that the background rate of plasmid
self-ligation was 1%.
To measure the mutation rates, we randomly selected 20 21B3
clones and 21 5H6 clones for sequencing with primers
pCWorifor and pCWorirev, allowing us to read each gene from
bp 18 to bp 1,436. The 21B3 clones contained a total of 95
nucleotide mutations in the 28,380 sequenced base pairs, with 28
synonymous mutations, 60 nonsynonymous mutations, and 7
mutations leading to premature truncation of the gene (frame-
shift or nonsense mutations). The 5H6 clones contained a total
of 87 mutations in the 29,799 sequenced base pairs, with 23
synonymous mutations, 55 nonsynonymous mutations, and 9
mutations leading to premature truncation of the gene. The
distributions of mutations in the two libraries were statistically
indistinguishable (Fig. 2A). After confirming that the mutation
rates in the two libraries were indistinguishable, we combined the
sequencing results for further analysis (Table 1). Fig. 2B shows
that the distribution of mutations is consistent with the theo-
retical distribution for error-prone PCR (49, 50), which gives the
probability that a mutant in a library with an average of 
mnt
mutations per gene has mnt nucleotide mutations as

,
[1]
where n is the number of PCR cycles,  is the PCR efficiency, and

mnt(1  )n. We also confirmed that the mutations were
distributed uniformly along the gene sequence (Fig. 2C). If each
position in the gene is equally likely to be mutated, then among
41 sequenced clones, 156.3 positions should be mutated once, 9.7
positions should be mutated twice, and 0.4 positions should be
mutated three times, in good agreement with the observed
values of 148, 13, and 1.
Screening for Improved Mutants. Single mutants were grown in
96-well deep-well plates in Luria broth (LB) supplemented with
100 gml ampicillin for 20–24 h at 30°C, 215 rpm, and 80%
relative humidity. One-hundred l of these LB cultures were
used to inoculate deep-well plates containing 400 l per well of
terrific broth (TB) supplemented with 100 gml ampicillin, 0.5
mM -aminolevulinic acid, and 0.2 mM isopropyl -D-
thiogalactoside (IPTG) and grown as before. The cells were
pelleted and frozen overnight and then lysed by resuspending
each well with 600 l of 100 mM [4-(2-hydroxyethyl)- 1-pipera-
zinepropanesulfonic acid] (EPPS) (pH 8.2) containing 0.5
mgml lysozyme and 2 unitsml DNase and incubating for 1 hour
at 37°C. The lysis debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and 80
l of clarified lysate was added to wells of microtiter plates and
then combined with 20 l of 6	 substrate stock (1.5 mM
12-pNCA in 36% DMSO or a 6	 stock containing 6% DMSO

and 6% acetone with substrate so that concentrations in the
stocks were 60 mM 3-phenoxytoluene, 60 mM naproxen, 150
mM phenoxyacetic acid, 30 mM 2-methylbenzofuran, or 30 mM
propranolol). Reactions were initiated by adding 20 l of 24 mM
hydrogen peroxide. Endpoints for the 12-pNCA assay were read
after 20–30 min at 398 nm (22), whereas endpoints for all other
substrate were taken after 1.5–2 h with the 4-amino antipyrene
(4-AAP) assay as described in ref. 28. More details are in
Supporting Materials and Methods.
The 21B3 and 5H6 mutant libraries were screened in parallel
by using consistent quantitative criteria for identifying improved
mutants. Briefly, all mutants with readings that were at least 50%
greater than the larger of the parental or null vector internal
standards on the 96-well plate were selected for rescreening.
Rescreening was performed by growing and assaying a full row
of a 96-well plate for each candidate mutant. Mutants that still
appeared at least 50% improved were then expressed in flasks
containing 200 ml of TB supplemented with 100 gml ampi-
cillin, 0.5 mM -aminolevulinic acid, and 0.4 mM IPTG. The
protein concentrations were normalized to 5 M, and verifica-
tion assays were performed in microtiter plates. All mutants
identified as improved were required to be at least 50% im-
proved over the parental activity or at least 50% improved over
the background reading if there was no parental activity. Sum-
mary statistics for this process are shown in Table 4, the final
readings in the verification assay are shown in Fig. 8, and a
comprehensive description of the methods is in the Supporting
Materials and Methods.
The T50 values were measured as described in ref. 26, except
that we measured retention of the peak in the carbon monoxide
difference spectrum (27) rather than retention of activity (Sup-
porting Materials and Methods). Site-directed mutants with the
L75R, F275S, and F205L substitutions were constructed by using
PCR overlap extension mutagenesis (51) and assayed for func-
tion as in the verification assays.
