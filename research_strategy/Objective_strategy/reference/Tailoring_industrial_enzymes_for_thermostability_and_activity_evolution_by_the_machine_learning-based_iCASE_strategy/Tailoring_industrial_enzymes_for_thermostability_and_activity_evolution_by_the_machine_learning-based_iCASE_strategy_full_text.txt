The pursuit of obtaining enzymes with high activity and stability remains
a grail in enzyme evolution due to the stability-activity trade-off. Here, we
develop an isothermal compressibility-assisted dynamic squeezing index
perturbation engineering (iCASE) strategy to construct hierarchical modular
networks for enzymes of varying complexity. Molecular mechanism analysis
elucidates that the peak of adaptive evolution is reached through a structural
response mechanism among variants. Furthermore, this dynamic response
predictive model using structure-based supervised machine learning is
established to predict enzyme function and ﬁtness, demonstrating robust
performance across different datasets and reliable prediction for epistasis. The
universality of the iCASE strategy is validated by four sorts of enzymes with
different structures and catalytic types. This machine learning-based iCASE
strategy provides guidance for future research on the ﬁtness evolution of
enzymes.
Enzymes are frequently applied in the food, textile, papermaking,
medicine, energy, and chemical industries to promote the production
of high-value products1. However, natural enzymes often cannot meet
the requirements of industrial production due to poor stability and low
activity under complex processing conditions. Designing more effec-
tive enzymes can help address severe risks to human populations, such
as energy shortages, environmental degradation, and food shortages.
In addition, the stability and activity trade-off frequently arises during
the process of enzyme evolution. To date, research on industrial
enzyme stability based on rational design has mainly focused on var-
ious factors that inﬂuence interactions of amino acids, such as
hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, protein sur-
face charges, disulﬁde bonds, and metal ions1–3. Improving and con-
trolling the level of enzymatic activity is the overarching goal of
enzyme engineering research, typically achieved through strategies
such as introducing mutations at the active site and optimizing them
for the target substrate4. Other methods, such as channel engineering,
modiﬁcation of dynamic properties, editing recognition elements
(such as loops), and targeting allosteric sites, have also proven
successful5–7. In previous studies, researchers have concentrated on
static local interactions3–7. However, general methods for identifying
key regulatory residues outside the active site are not yet perfect.
Owing to the multifaceted and intricate nature of enzymes, there are
no uniﬁed rules to guide strategies for improving the stability and
activity of industrial enzymes of varying degrees of complexity and
catalytic mechanism. Moreover, the effective binding between
enzymes and polymeric substrates is a complex and unpredictable
process, which presents challenges for identifying mutations that
enhance activity and stability, such as the binding mode of poly-
ethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolase and PET polymers. It is bene-
ﬁcial to identify the substrate binding mode to improve stability and
activity. Additionally, balancing the trade-off between stability and
activity presents an additional challenge.
The extraordinary proﬁciency exhibited by enzymes is ascribed to
the intricate network of amino acid interactions, harmonizing com-
munication among diverse regions of the protein to realize its

functional potential. A profound comprehension of the intricate
interrelations between enzyme sequence, structure, dynamics, and
function holds the promise of substantially amplifying the catalytic
capabilities of enzymes8. Industrial enzymes undergo functional evo-
lution dictated not merely by dominant structures but predominantly
by the dynamics of the enzymes. Dynamics, as a key regulatory para-
meter, play an important role in forming functions or adapting to
environments. Nevertheless, investigations into the evolutionary tra-
jectories of enzyme performance have predominantly focused on a
limited number of protein families and individual enzymes2,3,9,10. A
conspicuous lacuna persists in the formulation of universally applic-
able strategies efﬁcaciously augmenting the performance of enzymes
across varying structural complexities and types.
The ﬁtness landscape provides a perspective on the molecular
underpinnings of laboratory evolution. Intricate intramolecular inter-
actions between amino acids, reconﬁgured by evolution, lead to non-
additive effects on protein ﬁtness known as epistasis11,12. Epistasis
includes sign epistasis and amplitude epistasis13. Sign epistasis refers to
the scenario where a mutation exhibits contrasting effects when pre-
sent in isolation versus in conjunction with other mutations. Con-
versely, magnitude epistasis denotes a mutation’s consistent effects
whether occurring
in
isolation
or in combination with
other
mutations13,14. Positive epistasis occurs when the combined effect of
mutations is more beneﬁcial than their individual effects, driving the
evolutionary trajectory of the protein. In contrast, negative epistasis
arises from antagonistic mutations that detrimentally affect protein
ﬁtness. Moreover, epistasis is delineated into short-range and long-
range mutation effects. While interactions in short-range epistasis are
intuitively evident in structure, elucidating the mechanisms governing
supra-additive effects between amino acids positioned at spatially
distant locations requires further reﬁnement. Therefore, investigating
how amino acid interactions based on conformational dynamics
inﬂuence protein epistasis holds paramount signiﬁcance.
Machine learning (ML) depends on the examination and learning
patterns within datasets to modify the model parameters, enabling the
prediction of samples. It is increasingly utilized in computer-assisted
protein research. Models predicting protein ﬁtness evolution can be
mainly divided into sequence-based prediction models and structure-
based prediction models15. Most ML-based protein ﬁtness prediction
models are supervised, using numerical representations of protein
sequences as features and the corresponding observed ﬁtness as
labels, such as eUniRep, ECNet, and Mutcompute16–19. There are also
unsupervised inferring probabilistic models using multiple sequence
alignments like Potts-Models. Most sequence-based models are built
using linear equations or learning algorithms, which limit the potential
to predict nonlinear effects. In contrast, nonlinear models can account
for higher-order genetic interaction effects. Therefore, models like
EVmutation20, which considers residue pair interactions based on
Potts-Models, and DeepSequence VAE21, which considers interactions
among all residues, have been developed. Unsupervised prediction
models cannot utilize evolutionary data from tested variants available
during directed evolution, which may limit their accuracy in guiding
protein engineering.
In this study, we use layered modularization to modify enzymes of
varying complexity and construct hierarchical modular networks for
secondary structures, supersecondary structures, and domains,
respectively.

the rapid evolution of enzymes (Fig. 1). To validate the applicability of
this strategy to enzymes of varying structural complexities, we employ
the monomeric enzyme protein-glutaminase (PG), xylanase (XY) with a
typical super-secondary TIM barrel (β/α)8 structure, and hexamer
glutamate decarboxylase (GADA) as models for our study. Addition-
ally, a dynamic response predictive model using structure-based
supervised ML is established to forecast the function and ﬁtness of
other enzymes. Finally, we select MTGase (transferase, α + β), laccase
(oxidoreductase, all β), and PET hydrolase PES-H1 (hydrolase, α/β) to
further validate the generality of the iCASE strategy, and the stability
and activity are synergistically improved. These design principles can
inform the development of industrially robust biocatalysts for various
enzymes.
Results
Enzyme modiﬁcation with varying complexity by the iCASE
strategy
The iCASE strategy is a combination of stability and activity mod-
iﬁcation strategy for the selection of globally optimal mutants. For
simple-structured enzymes, we employed a secondary structure-based
iCASE strategy for enzyme engineering, using PG to validate the
results. PG (EC 3.5.1.44) is a monomeric enzyme that speciﬁcally con-
verts glutamine residues of proteins or peptides into glutamate and
releases ammonia22. Initially, the hot ﬂuctuation regions α1 (amino
acids 8–19), loop2 (amino acids 20–41), α2 (amino acids 42–55), and
loop6 (amino acids 102–113) were selected based on the ﬂuctuations in
isothermal compressibility (βT) (Fig. 2a). The results of molecular
docking showed that S35, S72, and S108 formed hydrogen bonds with
the ligand. The loop2 and loop6 were ﬂexible regions near the active
site, which might have been beneﬁcial for activity modiﬁcation (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1a). Subsequently, we proceeded to reﬁne the selec-
tion criteria of mutation sites within high-ﬂuctuation regions. By
combining modiﬁcations to the activity, we developed an indicator
dynamic squeezing index (DSI) coupled with the active center to
improve the activity of enzymes with varying degrees of complexity.
The residue with a DSI > 0.8 was selected as a candidate, representing
20% of the residues with the highest score (Fig. 2b). Moreover, changes
in free energy upon mutations (ΔΔG) were predicted using Rosetta 3.13
(Supplementary Table 1). Lastly, 11 mutants (G41I, R45K, A46K, H47F,
H47L, M49E, M49L, M49Y, S105E, L106E, and L106W) were screened
for use in wet experiments.
As shown in Fig. 2c, d, and Supplementary Data 1, the single-point
mutants H47L, M49E, and M49L showed 1.42-fold, 1.29-fold, and 1.82-
fold improvements in speciﬁc activity, respectively, with slightly
increased thermal stability compared to the wild type. The mutants
H47L, M49E, and M49L were then combined with the previously
identiﬁed positive mutants K48E, K48R, and S81E to generate double
mutants23. Compared to the wild type, the best double-point mutation
K48R/M49E exhibited a 1.74-fold increase in speciﬁc activity and nearly
unchanged stability, one of the highest comprehensive performances.
Other double-point mutations (such as K48E/M49L, K48E/M49E, and
M49E/S81E) had different degrees of improvement in the speciﬁc
activity. The multiple-sequence alignment analysis showed that the
mutant sites K48R and M49E were not conserved (Supplementary
Fig. 2a). This strategy can quickly screen the minimum mutation set to
obtain high stability and activity mutants.
To explore the performance of the iCASE strategy on higher-
structure enzymes, we used the supersecondary-structure-based
iCASE strategy for enzyme engineering, with XY as the object of
investigation. The alkaline-resistant XY (EC 3.2.1.8) from Bacillus
halodurans S7 presents a classical TIM barrel (β/α)8 and catalyzes the
degradation of the xylan into xylo-oligosaccharides24–26. The βTs of
secondary structures of the TIM barrel were calculated and high-
ﬂuctuation regions were identiﬁed as loop3 (amino acids 75-83), α2b
(amino acids 84–96), α3c (amino acids 130–155), loop18 (amino acids
278–289), α7a (amino acids 290–293), and α7b (amino acids 295–318)
(Fig. 2a). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1b, loop3 and loop18 were
ﬂexible loops close to the substrate. Subsequently, 13 single-point
mutants were selected as ultimate variants using DSI and Rosetta free
energy calculations (Supplementary Fig. 3a and Supplementary
Table 1). The best triple-point mutant R77F/E145M/T284R exhibited a

3.39-fold increase in speciﬁc activity and an increase in Tm of 2.4 °C
(Supplementary Data 1). Moreover, it could be observed that the three
mutation sites (R77, E145, and T284) were not conserved by multiple
sequence alignment (Supplementary Fig. 2b).
Given that the XY in this study is tolerant to salt and alkali, we
further investigated the effects of pH and salt on enzyme stability and
activity. The optimal pH for both wild type and R77F/E145M/T284R was
9.0 (Supplementary Table 2). The wild type was rapidly inactivated,
with a half-life of only 6.62 min, whereas the R77F/E145M/T284R
exhibited a signiﬁcantly extended half-life of 5 h (Supplementary
Fig. 4). The radius of gyration (Rg) of R77F/E145M/T284R was lower
than that of the wild type at pH 9.0, indicating that R77F/E145M/T284R
had a more compact structure. Additionally, the catalytic efﬁciency of
R77F/E145M/T284R was signiﬁcantly improved, being 1.41 times that of
the wild type (Supplementary Table 3). The binding afﬁnity between
R77F/E145M/T284R and the substrate was improved under high tem-
perature and alkaline conditions, thus improving the catalytic efﬁ-
ciency. The substitution of the negatively charged Glu at position 145
with Met at pH 9.0 reduced electrostatic repulsion, decreased elec-
trostatic energy, and increased van der Waals interactions, thereby
enhancing enzyme stability (Supplementary Fig. 4). The substitution of
hydrophobic amino acids for charged residues accelerated the folding
process of the enzyme27. The stability and catalytic efﬁciency of R77F/
E145M/T284R were superior to that of the wild type under different
salt concentration conditions. The constant-pH MD simulations results
revealed that the electrostatic energy and solvent accessible surface
area (SASA) of R77F/E145M/T284R was lower than that of the wild type
(Supplementary Fig. 4), indicating that the mutations optimized pro-
tein electrostatic interactions, thereby improving protein stability28–33.
The salt ion interactions were explored with the wild type and R77F/
E145M/T284R using MD simulations. Na+ cations were mainly con-
centrated on the enzyme surface and affected the stability and cata-
lytic efﬁciency of the enzyme. According to the MD simulations results
of XYWT and R77F/E145M/T284R, the decrease in electrostatic repul-
sion and electrostatic energy of R77F/E145M/T284R led to a decrease
in SASA. Given the signiﬁcant positive correlation between ΔCp and
SASA34, the decrease in ΔCp (−77.91 J/(°C g)) resulted in enhanced
stability of R77F/E145M/T284R27,34,35.
To further explore the performance of the iCASE strategy in
more complex polymerase enzymes, we employed the hexamer
GADA (EC 4.1.1.15) from E. coli as the research object, with the dimer
serving as the functional unit36. GADA catalyzes the decarboxylation
of L-glutamate to yield γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and releases
CO2
37. To investigate the interface interactions, we selected the
interface contacts in dimers as follows: loop1 (amino acids 27–38),
loop2 (amino acids 54–57), loop3 (amino acids 65–70), loop4 (amino
acids 298–301), loop5 (amino acids 315–319), α2 (amino acids 39–53),
α3 (amino acids 70–78), α4 (amino acids 91–107), α5 (amino acids
126–146), α6 (amino acids 165–172), α9 (amino acids 322–334), and
α10 (amino acids 335–346). As shown in Fig. 2a, the screened high-
ﬂuctuation regions on the interface of GAD were α2, α9, α6, and α3,
respectively. The α6 was a crucial region near the substrate binding
site (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Combined with DSI screening and
Rosetta free energy calculations of the high-ﬂuctuation regions, 16
mutants were obtained for experimental veriﬁcation (Supplementary
Table 1). The results implied that the speciﬁc activity of ﬁve mutants
(D40E, A42M, A42W, N47F, and H167F) signiﬁcantly increased, with
the D40E mutant showing the highest increase of up to 89.37%

mutations obtained by using this strategy can quickly reach the peak of the ﬁtness
landscape. Finally, Dynamic response predictive models based on machine learning
for protein function and ﬁtness were built, veriﬁed, and evaluated.

(Supplementary Data 1). The mutant A42W implied the highest Tm of
49.8 °C, which was 7.8 °C higher than that of the wild type. Ulti-
mately, ﬁve promising mutants (D40E, A42M, A42W, N47F, and
H167F) were selected for combination mutagenesis to further
improve the GADA performance.
The best mutation D40E/N47F/H167F showed a 2.34-fold increase
in the speciﬁc activity and a Tm increase of 2.0 °C compared with the
wild type. The positive mutation rates of mutants based on multiple
structural domain modiﬁcations were 71%. Within the three mutation
sites analyzed, it was observed that sites 40 and 47 were not conserved
while site 167 was conserved (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The successful
modiﬁcation for such higher-order mutations underscores the
potential of our approach. Moreover, the stability and anti-aggregation
of PG, XY, and GADA were evaluated under industrial conditions,
respectively. The results indicated that the stability and anti-
aggregation of the high-performance mutants obtained through the
iCASE strategy have improved compared to the wild type, demon-
strating that the iCASE strategy helps enhance enzyme stability under
industrial conditions (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5).
Fitness landscape analysis based on conformational dynamics
To elucidate the conformational dynamics mechanism underlying the
increased thermal stability and activity of the mutants, we analyzed the
characteristics of structural changes using MD simulations. The root
mean square deviation (RMSD), Rg, and root mean square ﬂuctuation
(RMSF) of mutants K48R/M49E, R77F/E145M/T284R, and D40E/N47F/
H167F were lower than those of the wild type, indicating that the
introduced mutations lead to a tighter protein packing, which may
contribute to the stability of the transition state (Supplementary
Figs. 6 and 7). A similar trend was observed in the dynamic cross-
correlation map (DCCM) analysis. Compared to the wild-type PG, the
substitution of Arg and Glu residues in mutant K48R/M49E increased
the positively correlated residue movements, which exhibited a posi-
tive effect on enzyme stability (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). The increase
in dynamic correlation strength indicated a stronger residue interac-
tion network. In the mutant R77F/E145M/T284R, a more positive
dynamics correlation between residues was observed in the super-
secondary structure region (Supplementary Fig. 8c, d). According to
the interface contact regions in the DCCM, there were more positive
correlations between residue movements in the mutant D40E/N47F/
H167F, indicating increased stabilization of the mutant (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 8e, f). The impact of mutations based on the iCASE strategy on
correlation was largely orthogonal, suggesting that this orthogonal
dynamic relationship may be crucial not only for the higher-order
epistasis of PG, XY, and GADA but also for the evolution of other
natural enzymes and designed enzymes.
The principal component analysis (PCA) results indicated that the
ﬁrst 20 principal components (PCs) in the wild type PG and K48R/
M49E accounted for 59.7% and 66.9% of the total contribution,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. 9). Speciﬁcally, in the wild type PG,
the total contribution of the ﬁrst two PCs (PC1 and PC2) was 22.6%,
whereas in the mutant K48R/M49E, the total contribution of the ﬁrst
two PCs reached 33.5%. These differences in the distribution of con-
formational states (represented by color-coded dots), implied that the
conformation of K48R/M49E was more compact than that of the wild-
type PG. Similar results were obtained in mutants R77F/E145M/T284R
and D40E/N47F/H167F (Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11). As shown in
Supplementary Fig. 12, the mutant K48R/M49E, R77F/E145M/T284R,
and D40E/N47F/H167F displayed a narrower conformational space
than their corresponding wild types. These results agree with the
experimental data.
Additionally, the substrate formed three hydrogen bonds with the
wild type PG, while two additional hydrogen bonds between K48R/
M49E with the substrate (Supplementary Fig. 13). The distance between
the hydrogen bond formed between the substrate and S108 of K48R/
M49E was reduced, suggesting that the mutation had a stronger
binding afﬁnity for the substrate, leading to an increase in enzyme
activity. We also investigated the potential substrate entry channels
within the wild-type PG and mutant K48R/M49E. The length and cur-
vature of the substrate channel in the mutant K48R/M49E were
decreased by 2.00 Å and 0.38 Å, respectively, indicating that a short
and straight substrate channel facilitated the entry of substrate mole-
cules and the release of product molecules (Supplementary Fig. 14 and
Supplementary Table 4). A similar trend was observed in mutants R77F/
E145M/T284R and D40E/N47F/H167F. These are consistent with the
experimental results. These ﬁndings demonstrate the potential for the
rational design of mutants with improved activity and stability, and
provide insight into the structure-function relationship of this enzyme.
The shortest path map is a promising computational method to
capture the inﬂuence of relevant distant residues38. The shortest path
analysis of the three mutation sites in XY revealed that there was no
signiﬁcant difference between the wild type and the mutant, indi-
cating that the same pathways were involved in long-range interac-
tions within the protein molecules (Fig. 2e). However, the shortest
path analysis results revealed that three mutation sites in mutant
D40E/N47F/H167F in GADA exhibited a shorter path compared to the
wild type, illustrating that the long-range interaction pathway
responsible for the allosteric regulation of protein molecules has
been shortened in the mutant. As a result, the mutant requires fewer
amino acid interactions to achieve improved functional proper-
ties (Fig. 2f).
Next, we focused on understanding the evolutionary processes
that generated the activity and stability of enzymes with different
degrees of complexity. We constructed the evolutionary pathways
based on both activity and stability, gaining insights into the diverse
routes that evolution could follow (Fig. 3a–c). In the active evolu-
tionary pathway analysis, the mutants obtained using this strategy
quickly reached their peak. As shown in Fig. 3a, the K48R and M49E
mutants of PG exhibited positive effects when present alone (with
activities 1.54-fold and 2.29-fold that of the wild type, respectively).
Cooperative activity was observed between K48R and M49E, resulting
in an activity 2.74-fold greater than that of the wild type, illustrating the
occurrence of magnitude epistasis. Similar results were observed for
XY, including the mutants R77F/T284R, N136F/T284R, E153L/T264R,
and E145M/T284R (Fig. 3b). Mutation T284R was individually beneﬁcial
in activity. When T284R was combined with the other mutants (R77F,
N136F, E145M, and E153L), the overall performance of the combina-
torial mutants in the activity was further improved. In addition, the PG
mutants H47L/K48R, H47L/K48E, K48R/M49L, and M49L/S81E exhib-
ited signs of epistasis, that is from being deleterious to beneﬁcial or
vice versa39. In the case of GADA, the mutant D40E/N47F/H167F was
considered to have a single maximum across the entire landscape,
without any alternative local maxima (Fig. 3c). This indicated a clear
evolutionary path with a single optimal solution for this particular
enzyme. During the process of stability evolution, intermediate local
maxima were often observed in PG, XY, and GADA, possibly because of
the trade-off between stability and activity, where stability is sacriﬁced
to some extent during the evolutionary process to achieve greater
enzyme activity. The enhanced positive dynamic correlation in mutant
variants revealed a stronger residue interaction network. PCA of the
enzyme’s conformational landscape revealed that the introduction of
mutations increases the conformational freedom of protein. The
synergistic interplay between dynamic interactions and conforma-
tional dynamics resulted in this non-additive interaction, accelerating
enzyme evolution.
We further evaluated the correlation between compressibility
and stability of the mutants (Fig. 3d–f). The ΔβT showed a negative
Pearson correlation with Tm, with Pearson coefﬁcients of r = −0.52,
−0.53, and −0.64 for the three enzymes, respectively, consistent with
our hypothesis that decreasing the βT could improve the stability.

Additionally, we analyzed the changes in the DSI values of mutants
and found that mutants with increased activity exhibited larger DSI
values, indicating a high coupling between the mutation sites and the
activity center (Supplementary Fig. 15). This result suggested that a
high level of coupling with the active sites was favorable for
improving activity.
Machine learning-based dynamic response predictive model
To expand the applicability of the iCASE strategy, considering the
design-build-test-learn framework, we established the supervised
dynamic response predictive model to predict protein function and
ﬁtness by utilizing evolutionary data and assay-labeled data. The
workﬂow used to build, verify, and evaluate the model is illustrated in

Fig. 4a. We evaluated the model’s performance using Spearman’s ρ
across ten datasets with different numbers of variants (Supplemen-
tary Table 5). These ten datasets contained data on single, double,
and multiple substituted variants. We selected seven features (βT,
DSI, RMSD, Rg, SASA, hydrophobicity, and charge) related to enzyme
function and ﬁtness evolution as input. Speciﬁcally, βT measures the
ﬂuctuation of protein structure, RMSD assesses parameters of pro-
tein structure change and stability, Rg indicates protein compact-
ness, SASA, and charge inﬂuence protein-solvent interactions
affecting stability and activity, hydrophobicity impacts protein
folding and stability, and DSI quantiﬁes the coupling strength
between amino acid residues in protein networks and considers the
impact of combinatorial mutations and epistasis on ﬁtness. We
compared three nonlinear regression models (k-nearest neighbors,
support vector regression, and random forest regression) and linear
regression on their performance for ten datasets. The random forest
regression model consistently demonstrated superior performance
across nine datasets, and thus, it has been adopted as the default
method (Fig. 4b). Subsequently, the VIP values of each feature in the
ten datasets were calculated, and it was found that ﬁve features
contribute signiﬁcantly to enzyme function and ﬁtness evolution
(Fig. 4c). Therefore, βT, DSI, RMSD, Rg, and SASA were selected as
input features.
The dynamic response predictive model successfully cap-
tured the inﬂuences of mutations in low-throughput experiments
on the stability of beta-glucosidase (ρ = 0.74, N = 21), ubiquitin
(ρ = 0.90, N = 30), beta-lactamase (ρ = 0.80, N = 30), RML lipase
(ρ = 0.78, N = 28), FYN (SH3 domain) (ρ = 0.79, N = 55), trypsin
(ρ = 0.82, N = 23), Hepatitis C NS5A (ρ = 0.83, N = 240). Further-
more, in high-throughput experiments, the model demonstrated
robust performance in predicting ﬁtness for beta-lactamase
(ρ = 0.86, N = 4998) and poly-A binding protein (PABP) (RRM
domain) (ρ = 0.76, N = 1188), including double and multiple sub-
stitutions. These results indicated that this model can be utilized
for designing proteins with improved stability or ﬁtness (Fig. 4d).
The model’s performance in predicting the activity of RML lipase
and trypsin was 0.62 and 0.47, respectively. For high-throughput
datasets, the overall model performance increases as the training
dataset increases (Fig. 4e). In addition to the training dataset of
48 in beta-lactamase, this may be the selection of mutants that
may favor our correlation. Furthermore, the out-of-box predic-
tion performance was evaluated across ten datasets, with most
out-of-bag
(OOB)
scores
being
above
0.4
(Supplementary
Fig. 16a). Using PABP and PG to train on singly substituted var-
iants and predict more highly substituted variants, the OOB
scores were 0.60 and 0.21, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 16b).
Furthermore, the interpolation performances were greater than
0.60 on most datasets (Fig. 4f).
To evaluate the ability of the model to predict the epistasis of
combined mutations in low and high N datasets, we examined the
model’s substitutional extrapolation ability on two datasets by training
on single substituted variants and predicting higher substituted var-
iants. The enrichment scores of PABP (Ntrain = 1188, Ntest = 2000) and
the thermostability of PG variants (Ntrain = 45, Ntest = 35) were used to
validate the extrapolation performances of the model. The extra-
polation performances of PABP and PG were 0.72 and 0.60, respec-
tively (Fig. 4g). The extrapolation performances of PABP showed no
signiﬁcant change with the increase of the training dataset (Supple-
mentary Fig. 16c). The results indicated that the model exhibited a
robust ability to capture epistasis for both low and high N datasets.
Extrapolation performance also depends on the degree to which
epistasis contributes to the ﬁtness landscape40. The prediction results
for PG may be inﬂuenced by the presence of more diverse effects (both
deleterious and beneﬁcial) or non-additive effects in multi-site com-
binatorial mutations.
Validation of the iCASE strategy transferability
Furthermore, we applied the iCASE strategy to different types of
enzymes, selecting transferases, oxidoreductase, and hydrolases for
validation. We selected microbial transglutaminase (MTGase, α + β),
laccase (all β), and PET hydrolase (PES-H1, α/β) from different SCOP
structural classiﬁcations as our study subjects. Firstly, highly active and
stable mutants of microbial transglutaminase (MTGase, EC 2.3.2.13)
were constructed. Seven potential mutants A212P, R215L, D221T, A216I,
S246H, V252L, and S303P were selected according to the iCASE strat-
egy (Supplementary Fig. 17a–c). The Tm values of mutants S246H,
A212P, D221T, and R215L increased by 1.5 °C, 1.4 °C, 0.9 °C, and 0.5 °C,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. 17d). The speciﬁc enzyme activities
of all seven mutants were improved, with R215L exhibiting a 3.48-fold
increase compared to the wild type, which was one of the mutants with
the best comprehensive performance (Supplementary Fig. 17e). A
representative oxidoreductase, laccase (EC 1.10.3.2) derived from
Bacillus subtilis is an all-β type protein. Six mutants were obtained by
using the iCASE strategy. The Tm values of mutants H86W, S91T, G321P,
G323N, and G324H increased by 1.3 °C, 4.1 °C, 5.1 °C, 2.6 °C, and 1.8 °C,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. 18a). The speciﬁc activities of H86W,
S91T, G321P, and G324H were 1.52, 1.08, 1.18, 3.36, and 1.33 times that
of the wild type, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 18b).
Furthermore, we also selected a canonical PET hydrolase (PES-H1,
EC 3.1.1.101) with a canonical α/β-hydrolase fold for veriﬁcation41. The
iCASE strategy is used to identify the high ﬂuctuation regions α3
(94–110, interface contact region), α6 (184–192), and loop5 (60–65)
(Fig. 5a). Moreover, we conducted the molecular docking of the wild
type in complex with the substrate 3PET (three repeating PET units). As
shown in Fig. 5b, two hydrogen bonds were formed between the
substrate and G65 and S130 in the wild type. Hydrophobic interactions
were formed between the substrate and residues I178 and L209.
Additionally, H129 and H208 formed salt bridges with the substrate in
the wild type. The loop5 is the critical ﬂexible region of PES-H1 that
interacts with 3PET. Subsequently, the DSI and free energy on these
regions were calculated (Fig. 5c). Combined with the results of the
prediction model, 9 single-point mutants were selected for wet
experimental veriﬁcation.
The nine mutants all exhibited an increase in enzymatic activity,
with T63H showing a particularly remarkable 11.09-fold improvement
(Fig. 5d). Additionally, the stability of the mutants T63H, A64F, R98L,
and S185N was enhanced, with T63H and A64F displaying a signiﬁcant
increase in Tm by 7.5 °C, and the Tm of T63H reaching 85.9 °C (Fig. 5e).
At 70 °C, the residual activity of the positive mutants was higher than
that of the wild type, indicating that the positive mutant exhibited
greater stability (Supplementary Fig. 19). The stability and anti-
aggregation of the wild type and T63H were assessed under indus-
trial conditions (70 °C, pH 9.0). T63H exhibited superior stability and
anti-aggregation compared to the wild type (Supplementary Fig. 20).
In addition, T63H demonstrated superior performance in hydrolyzing
low-crystallinity (<15%) PET ﬁlms. The PET ﬁlm treated with the wild
type displayed a slightly rough surface, while the PET ﬁlm treated with
the mutant T63H exhibited a surface that was rough and porous
(Fig. 5f). The weight loss of PET ﬁlm treated with T63H for 12 h at 70 °C
was 94%, nearly achieving complete degradation of the PET ﬁlm
(Supplementary Fig. 21).
To further investigate the mechanism of PET hydrolysis, we con-
ducted molecular docking and MD simulations of wild type and T63H
in complex with the substrate 3PET, respectively. T63H formed an
extra hydrogen bond with the substrate compared to the wild type
(Supplementary Fig. 22a–d). This result suggested that T63H had a
stronger binding afﬁnity for the substrate, leading to an increase in
enzyme activity. In the wild type, hydrophobic interactions were
formed between the substrate and residues I178 and L209, while in
T63H, these interactions involved not only I178 and L209 but also
residues N212 and T213. Additionally, H129 and H208 formed salt

bridges with the substrate in both the wild type and T63H. The binding
free energy of the T63H complex was −66.43 kJ/mol, which was
19.73 kJ/mol lower than that of the wild type (Supplementary Fig. 22e).
The energy decomposition analysis revealed the pivotal roles played
by amino acids L209, I178, W155, R91, and H129 (Supplementary
Fig. 22f). These validation results indicate that the iCASE strategy has
the potential to rationally design mutants with higher activity and
stability, quickly screen for high-performance single-point mutants,
accelerate the search for ﬁtness evolutionary peaks, and provide
insights into the structure-function relationship of enzymes.
Discussion
Given the sophisticated structures of enzymes, the computational
prediction of mutations that can generate greater functions is chal-
lenging. In this study, we developed a design strategy to evolve the
thermal stability and activity of enzymes with varying degrees of
complexity, using the iCASE strategy based on multi-dimensional
conformational dynamics. As illustrated in our previous research23,42,
the differences in stability between the wild type and mutants could be
elucidated by examining the evolving features of βT through compu-
tational analysis. The increase in activity can be attributed to the
characteristic spectral changes in the DSI, which are closely correlated
with the dynamics of the active center. Our successful implementation
of a dynamics-based design methodology highlights the signiﬁcance of
considering protein dynamics and conformational interactions in the
engineering of enzymes using this approach. This strategy system-
atically introduced mutations in speciﬁc regions, greatly reducing the
experimental effort needed to achieve a high positive rate, and over-
coming the stability and activity trade-off.
The iCASE strategy was employed to validate three enzymes with
different structures and catalytic mechanisms: microbial transglutami-
nase (MTGase, α + β), laccase (all β), and PET hydrolase (PES-H1, α/β). It
was found that high-performance single-point mutants could be rapidly
screened using this strategy. In particular, the optimal single-point
mutant R215L for MTGase achieved a speciﬁc activity of 109.99 U/mg,
which was higher than that of the combinatorial mutant R57L/Y198F/
F259W modiﬁed by cavity engineering strategy previously reported43.
The iCASE strategy could be widely applied to the rational design
of enzymes with different structures and types. In industrial
applications involving conditions such as high temperatures,
extreme pH, and high salt concentrations, the iCASE strategy was
utilized to screen and mutate charged residues to optimize the
surface charge of enzymes, thereby improving long-term stability
(e.g., thermostability and anti-aggregation) and activity of the
enzymes under industrial conditions.
By systematically analyzing the evolutionary pathways of enzymes
with varying levels of complexity, we found that some feasible evolu-
tionary paths exist in the vicinity of the local optima. However, the
most probable path to globally optimal ﬁtness is often hindered by
widespread ﬁtness valleys. The reason for this phenomenon may be
the hindrance caused by competitive interactions, which obstruct the
overall optimization of the system and give rise to numerous local
maxima, leading to a frustrating effect44. The result showed that the
experimentally determined enzyme activity landscape exhibited a
degree of frustration, as individually beneﬁcial mutants often proved
mutually incompatible, resulting in a rugged ﬁtness landscape. Addi-
tionally, it is important to note that the landscape described here was
generated through constant selection for a single activity or stability
and thus cannot be directly compared to evolutionary pathways
leading to functions. However, the landscape may be subject to sig-
niﬁcant changes due to evolving environmental conditions or varying
selection pressures45.
The dynamic response predictive model is a supervised structure-
based model, covering proteins of different types and structures.
Similar to ProteinMPNN46, starting from the protein structure, we
calculated feature values using protein structure information, con-
sidering dynamic structure information, and veriﬁed the key feature
values that affected enzyme function and ﬁtness evolution. Among
these, the DSI feature quantiﬁed the coupling strength between amino
acid residues in the protein network and considered the impact of
combinatorial mutations and epistasis on ﬁtness. The model demon-
strated robust performance on ten datasets with different data sizes.
Further experiments on combined mutation datasets showed that the
iCASE strategy could generalize from low-order mutants to high-order
mutants. The dynamic response prediction model performed better
than EVmutation on the datasets trypsin, FYN (SH3 domain), ubiquitin,
and beta-glucosidase20. The performances of the dynamic response
prediction model on the datasets beta-lactamase, ubiquitin, and
hepatitis C NS5A were better than that of Augment EV mutation Potts,
Augmented DeepSequence VAE, Augmented eUniRep, Augmented
transformer, etc. The performance on the dataset PABP (RRM domain)
was similar to that of Augment EV mutation Potts40. The model holds
promise for further applications in enzyme engineering for the func-
tion and ﬁtness evolution of other enzymes. To gain more valuable
insights into proteins, it is recommended that dynamic response pre-
dictive models be integrated with other methods within high-
throughput annotation platforms for omics data analysis.
Methods
Isothermal compressibility analysis
The Gibbs free energy (ΔG) between the native and unfolded varies of
the protein with pressure and temperature in reversible reactions as
follows:
d ΔG
ð
Þ =  ΔSdT + ΔVdp
ð1Þ
In constant temperature, Eq. (1) has the Taylor second-order
expansion as follows:
ΔG p
ð Þ = ΔG0 + ΔV 0 p  p0

ð2Þ
Where ΔG0 and ΔV 0 stand for reference conditions, p and p0 are the
pressure and standard atmospheric pressure, respectively, and βT is
the isothermal compressibility47. βT is one of the vital parameters to
assess protein stability.
The crystal structure of PG (PDB ID: 2ZK9), XY (PDB ID: 2UWF),
GADA (PDB ID: 1XEY), MTGase (PDB ID: 3IU0), laccase (PDB ID: 1GSK),
and PES-H1 (PDB ID: 7CUV) were used as the initial model, respectively.
The structures of the mutants were predicted by AlphaFold248. MD
simulations were performed using Amber 20 with an FF14SB force
ﬁeld. The system was solvated in a 15 Å cubic using TIP4PEW water box
with neutralizing ions. The temperature was maintained at 310 K, and
pressure was set to 1 bar, 500 bar, 1000 bar, 2000 bar, and 4000 bar,
respectively. The MD simulation was run for 50 ns. Structure analysis
was performed using PyMOL 3.0. RMSD, Rg, and RMSF were calculated
with the cpptraj tool. DCCM, PCA, and free energy landscape (FEL)
were analyzed using Bio3D49. βT was analyzed using simulation data
according to Zheng et al.23,42.
Dynamic squeezing index analysis
DSI was employed to evaluate the intensity of coupling between
residues within the protein network. Speciﬁcally, the DSI score
between residue “i” and the active center was determined by the
ratio of the volume ﬂuctuation of residue “i” when the active
center (within 5 Å around the center of mass) was perturbed to
the volume ﬂuctuation of residue “i” when all amino acids were

Based on linear response theory8,52, MD simulations were per-

sites were selected with DSI > 0.8.
Construction, expression, and puriﬁcation of mutants
Site-directed mutations were performed using the Fast Mutagenesis
Kit. Primer sequences were summarized in Supplementary Data 2. The
PG, XY, GADA, MTGase, laccase, PES-H1, and their mutants were
induced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) at OD600 0.6 with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-
thiogalactoside for 20 h at 16 °C. Following ultrasonic cell disruption,
crude extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 r/min for
20 min. The enzyme was eluted with different concentrations of imi-
dazole using an AKTA protein puriﬁcation system (GE Healthcare, NJ,
USA) in conjunction with a 1 mL His Trap FF nickel column.
Determination of enzyme properties
The enzymatic activity of PG was determined according to Zheng
et al.23. Ten microliter of enzyme solution was transferred into 96-well
plates to react with 100 μL of 10 mM Cbz–Gln–Gly for 30 min at 37 °C.
Then, 100 μL of 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to terminate the
reaction. Subsequently, 12 μL of reaction solution was mixed with
60 μL of chromogen solution A (40.46 g/L phenol and 0.15 g/L sodium
nitroprusside), 30 μL of chromogen solution B (49.94 g/L KOH), and
60 μL of chromogen solution C (20.004 g/L K2CO3 and 83.3% (v/v)
NaClO), followed by incubation for 20 min at 37 °C. The enzymatic
activity was calculated from the absorbance at 630 nm determined.
XY assay was carried out using the dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS)
method53. One hundred microliter of diluted enzyme solution was
mixed with 700 μL of 1% corn cob xylan (pH 9.0) and allowed to react
for 10 min at 70 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 700 μL of
DNS, and heating at 100 °C for 10 min. After cooling to room tem-
perature, sample absorbance was measured at 540 nm. The enzymatic
activity was calculated according to the absorbance.
GADA assay was measured by the Berthelot method54. 100 μL of
enzyme solution was mixed with 1 mL 50 mM sodium glutamate and
10 mM pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (pH 4.8) and allowed to react for 30 min
at 37 °C. Then, 500 μL of reaction solution was mixed with 1 mL of
200 mM sodium borate solution (pH 9.0), 1 mL of 6% phenol solution,
and 1 mL of 5% sodium hypochlorite solution, then boiled for 10 min.
After cooling to room temperature, the absorbance values were read at
630 nm. Finally, the enzymatic activity was calculated according to the
absorbance.
The enzyme activity of MTGase was determined by referring to
Zhang et al.43. Sixty microliters of the enzyme solution was added to
150 μL of the substrate solution (10 mg/mL CBZ–Gln–Gly, 7 mg/mL
hydroxylamine hydrochloride, and 3 mg/mL glutathione, pH 6.0) and
incubated at 50 °C for 10 min. Then, 60 μL of 12% trichloroacetic acid
was added, and the absorbance was measured at 525 nm.
The activity of laccase was determined as follows: 45 μL of the
enzyme solution was added to 255 μL of the ABTS solution and incu-
bated at 60 °C for 20 min. The absorbance values were read at 420 nm.
The enzymatic activity of PET was determined according to Cui
et al.55. Eighty microliters of phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.5), 10 μL
of para-nitrophenyl butyrate (p-NPB), and 10 μL of enzyme solution
were added into an EP tube, gently mixed, and heated at 70 °C for
5 min. Subsequently, 100 μL of ethanol was added to the mixture. The
activity was measured at 405 nm. Fifty micrograms of the enzyme were
used to degrade the PET ﬁlm (~45 mg) in 1 mL of 50 mM glycine-NaOH
buffer (pH 9.0) at 70 °C for 12 h. Then the weight loss rate of the PET
ﬁlm was measured. The surface morphology of the PET ﬁlm was
identiﬁed by scanning electron microscopy using the FEI Quanta 200
(magniﬁcation, ×5000).
For thermal stability measurement, 20 μL of enzyme solution and
5 μL of SYPRO orange dye were mixed and added to the 96-well PCR
plate. Afterward, the plate was subjected to gradual heating in a real-
time quantitative PCR system, starting from 25 °C and increasing at a
rate of 1 °C per minute until reaching 95 °C.
PROTEOSTAT protein aggregation assay was used to detect pro-
tein
aggregation.
The
protein
concentration
is
approximately
50 μg/mL. Ninty-eight microliter of protein and 2 μL of the diluted
PROTEOSTAT detection reagent were mixed and added to the 96-well
PCR plate. Incubate the microplate containing test samples in the dark
for 15 min. Fluorescence was read at excitation and emission wave-
lengths of 550 nm and 600 nm, respectively.
Dynamic response predictive model
The random forest, support vector regression, K-nearest neighbors,
and linear regression were employed to establish the dynamic
response predictive models for enzyme function and ﬁtness, respec-
tively. Ten different-sized datasets (~8700 mutants) were used for
training and testing, including beta-glucosidase56, Ubiquitin57, beta-
lactamase58,
Rhizomucor
miehei
lipase59,
FYN
(SH3
domain)60,
Trypsin61, Hepatitis C NS5A62, beta-lactamase63, PABP (RRM domain)64,
and PG23,51. Then we performed data integration, data cleaning, and
feature selection to ensure the quality and relevance of the data. Fea-
tures for both the wild type and mutations were generated by the
simulation software AMBER 20 and GROMACS 2023.4, including βT,
DSI, RMSD, Rg, SASA, hydrophobicity, and charge. These features
served as input variables, while the function and ﬁtness of the enzymes
acted as the target variables. The input data was normalized to ensure
that different features had similar scales. Feature selection was per-
formed with the variable importance in projection (VIP), which was
calculated based on each feature’s contribution to model performance
(the decrease in Gini impurity) during node splitting in the random
forest trees. In the inner loop, we utilized ﬁve-fold cross-validation for
hyperparameter optimization, designating 20% of the training data as
validation data. For the outer loop, we implemented ﬁve-fold cross-
validation to assess the model, averaging the validation results over
the randomized data splits. The code is written by Python 3.11 and is
accessible
