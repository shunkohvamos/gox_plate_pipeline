Multi-objective optimisation algorithms (MOOAs) are, of increasing interest for the efficient 
optimisation of chemical processes. However, an algorithms performance can vary on a case-by-case 
basis, depending on the complexity of the search space and the nature of the underlying response 
surfaces. This makes appropriate algorithm selection for chemical reaction optimisation a challenging 
problem. An open-source reaction simulator has been developed, which enables the performance of 
multi-objective algorithms to be benchmarked against a series of chemistry-inspired test problems. 
The performance of four different MOOAs were compared, including three state-of-the-art Bayesian 
optimisation algorithms, and their ability to optimise different types of systems quantified using the 
hypervolume metric. In general, EIMEGO was found to achieve the highest hypervolume in the lowest 
number of experiments and was only outperformed by TSEMO in cases with three objectives. To verify 
the simulated results, EIMEGO and TSEMO were tested experimentally using a three-objective 
optimisation of methyl phenyl sulfide oxidation. Both algorithms successfully identified a trade-off 
between conversion, selectivity, and productivity with respect to the desired sulfoxide. In this case, 
TSEMO outperformed EIMEGO in terms of hypervolume, which was in agreement with the simulated 
results. 
 
Introduction 
With the current digital transformation in manufacturing, 
known as Industry 4.0, there has been a rise in the 
digitalisation of chemistry. Intelligent systems fuelled by data 
and machine learning enable the automation of complex 
tasks, such as route design and reaction discovery, as well as 
more routine experimentation, such as synthesis, reaction 
screening 
and 
optimisation 
studies.1–5 
Specifically, 
‘self-optimising’ systems utilise machine learning algorithms 
to define the next set of reaction conditions to explore, based 
on the results of the previous experiments.6 Reaction 
optimisation is considered to be an expensive-to-evaluate 
problem, 
with 
staff 
time 
and 
high-value 
materials 
contributing to a significant expense. Therefore, it is 
imperative that self-optimising systems are able to find the 
global optimum in as few experiments as possible, whilst 
maximising the amount of information gained per 
experiment. This has recently led to the application of 
Bayesian optimisation algorithms, which aim to balance the 
trade-off between exploration and exploitation.7 This 
approach has also been used to enable multi-objective 
reaction optimisation, which has been shown to save time 
and resources by simultaneously optimising multiple 
performance criteria.8 Notably, these identify the trade-off 
curve (Pareto front) between conflicting objectives (e.g. 
economic vs. environmental), which provides valuable 
information 
during 
the 
development 
of 
chemical 
processes.9,10 
The end-user of these systems is typically a chemist, who in 
general does not have an extensive knowledge of 
programming and algorithm design. However, the efficiency 
of the optimisations is dependent on the algorithm selected 
on a case-by-case basis. So, how does a chemist know which 
algorithm to use and when? This question does not have a 
single answer, as the performance of algorithms can vary 
depending on the type of problem.11 Furthermore, it would 
be unrealistic to compare multiple algorithms using an 
experimental platform, as this would be very expensive and 
time-consuming. Therefore, in computer science, algorithm 
performance is compared on a series of different in silico test 
problems 
which 
are 
designed 
to 
have 
different 
characteristics. 
However, 
these 
test 
problems 
are 
mathematical functions, which do not relate to chemical

reaction applications. A series of chemistry inspired test 
problems based on reaction models would be more 
informative. This approach was recently reported by Lapkin 
et al., where an open-source framework (Summit) was 
produced to compare algorithms on chemically-motivated 
benchmarks.12 Herein, we report six test problems designed 
to compare multi-objective optimisation algorithms. The 
suitability of each algorithm for different types of chemical 
reactions is identified.  
Additionally, 
a 
comparison 
of 
two 
algorithms 
is 
experimentally performed to validate the findings proposed 
by the theoretical models. The reaction of selective organic 
sulfide oxidation by hydrogen peroxide is used to showcase 
experimentally the differences in algorithms and the 
additional challenges. This model reaction is well studied due 
to its pharmaceutical value13,14 but is furthermore of interest 
for simulation of chemical warfare agent degradation.15,16 The 
reaction is accessible, safe and simplistic and therefore ideal 
to study experimentally. Whilst standard experimental 
studies have previously been able to find optima for one 
objective by changing one variable at a time,17 self-optimized 
studies are able to correlate variables in a coherent 
functionality to multi-objectives.18 
Multi-Objective Reaction Simulator 
To compare the performance of multi-objective optimisation 
algorithms for optimising chemical systems, a kinetic-based 
reaction simulator was designed. Four reactions with known 
kinetic parameters (pre-exponential factors and activation 
energies) were chosen from the literature: (i) Van de Vusse 
reaction (VdV1); (ii) nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr1 
& SNAr2) between 2,4-difluoronitrobenzene and morpholine; 
(iii) isomerisation of lactose to lactulose (Lactose1); (iv) Paal-
Knorr reaction (PK1 & PK2) between 2,5-hexanedione and 
ethanolamine (see SI for schemes).19–22 These examples 
provided a good representation of non-competitive (iv) and 
competitive reactions, including competing parallel (i, ii & iii) 
and consecutive pathways (ii & iii). Although reactions (iii) and 
(iv) contain reversible reactions, the k-1 rate constants are 
negligible and were therefore omitted. Six test problems 
were formulated using reaction variable limits as constraints 
and different process metrics as objectives. Details and visual 
representations of the variable and objective space for each 
test problem are provided in the supporting information. A 
summary of the test problems including descriptions of the 
Pareto fronts is provided in Table 1. Each problem was 
designed to contain between 2-4 variables and 2-3 objectives, 
as higher dimensional problems are not often encountered 
with current self-optimising chemical platforms, due to the 
self-optimisation of more complex multi-step processes and 
mixed variable problems remaining in their infancy. 
Furthermore, the variable limits and objectives for each 
problem were selected to ensure that a diverse range of 
Pareto fronts were generated in terms of morphology, 
uniformity and continuity. This was important to ensure that 
the robustness and different capabilities of the algorithms 
could be benchmarked against the standardised test 
problems.23 
The simulation procedure for each test problem is outlined 
below. Firstly, the pre-exponential factors, A, and activation 
energies, Ea, were used to calculate the rate constants, k, for 
each step in the reaction using the Arrhenius equation. The 
differential rate equations for each step were then solved 
using an ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver. This 
provided the percentage of each species in the reaction 
mixture under different sets of conditions, which were 
subsequently used to calculate the objectives for the given 
test problem. Random noise, at a level inherent with precise, 
automated experimental systems, was also included by 
applying a maximum absolute error of 0.25% and maximum 
relative error of 0.5% to the outputs.24 
To compare the performance of the algorithms, the 
hypervolume was calculated after each iteration, where the 
hypervolume is defined as the volume between the current 
Pareto front and a reference point (i. e. larger hypervolume = 
better Pareto front). The hypervolume was calculated using a 
Monte-Carlo 
approximation, 
which 
determined 
the 
proportion of 100,000 random points in the objective space 
which were dominated by the current Pareto front, 𝑃.  
Formally, given n samples drawn uniformly from 𝑅𝑘, where k 
is the number of objectives, within the hyperrectangle [𝑃, 𝑅], 
with 𝑅 being the reference point for the calculation, the 
following can be defined:25,26 
𝐻𝑀𝐶= 1
𝑛∑𝐼(𝑃≤𝑌𝑖)
𝑛
𝑖=1
 
(1) 
𝑌𝑖 is the ith objective vector generated from the Monte-Carlo 
sampling process. 𝐼(∙) returns 1 if the argument is true and 0 
if false. An illustrative example of the estimation procedure is 
provided in Error! Reference source not found.. 
The utopian and anti-utopian points are defined as the 
combination of the best and the combination of the worst 
solutions for each objective respectively.  
Figure 1. Illustrative example of Monte-Carlo based hypervolume approximation 
procedure. The hypervolume is the proportion of 100,000 random points in the 
objective space which are dominated by the current Pareto front. 
These points were determined for the objective space of each 
problem by creating a superset of the non-dominated 
solutions from all runs across all algorithms. The reference

The code required to simulate each of these test problems is 
available online (https://github.com/adamc1994/MultiChem) 
and can be used to benchmark the performance of any multi-
objective optimisation algorithm (MOOA). Herein, we use this 
simulator to benchmark the performance of five MOOAs for 
chemical reaction applications. As these applications require 
physical experiments to be conducted, which can take several 
tens of minutes and require expensive reagents, minimising the 
number of experiments required is paramount. Therefore, the 
optimisation performance is compared based on minimising the 
number of iterations required to achieve a high hypervolume.

efficient 
multi-objective optimisation (TSEMO), Pareto efficient global 
optimisation (ParEGO), NSGA-II and expected improvement 
matrix efficient global optimisation (EIM-EGO) were compared 
using the developed approach.27–30 TSEMO, ParEGO and EIM-
EGO are state-of-the-art Bayesian optimisation algorithms 
designed independently from each other for expensive-to-
evaluate problems, thus making them well-suited for the 
optimisation of chemical reactions using experimental 
platforms. In contrast, NSGA-II is a computationally fast and 
elitist MOOA which generally requires many iterations, thus 
providing a suitable comparison for this study. Implementations 
of ParEGO, NSGA-II and EIM-EGO were all available in the 
platform 
for 
evolutionary 
multi-objective 
optimisation 
(PlatEMO) toolbox in MATLAB.31 An implementation of TSEMO 
was available on GitHub, and was compared with experimental 
batches of one and four (batch sequential, BS-TSEMO) per 
iteration.32 For the self-optimisation of chemical reactions, 
operating in batch sequential mode has the advantage of 
reducing the overall optimisation time in cases where the 
analysis time creates a bottleneck in the experiment.  
The TSEMO, BS-TSEMO, ParEGO and EIM-EGO were initialised 
using a Latin hypercube (LHC, size = 20) for maximal 
experimental distribution.33 Each algorithm had a function 
evaluation budget of 100 and was ran 20 times for each test 
problem to compare average performance. To account for the 
function evaluation budget, the NSGA-II population size and 
total number of generations were changed to 20 and 5 
respectively. 
Plots showing the average change in hypervolume throughout 
the optimisations are shown in Error! Reference source not 
found.. Furthermore, boxplots of the optimisation results after 
60 function evaluations are displayed in Error! Reference 
source not found., which provides a more detailed view at a 
practical number of experiments. From these results, the 
following observations and conclusions can be made: 
 
▪ The NSGA-II algorithm has the lowest hypervolume after any 
number of function evaluations beyond the initial dataset in 
all examples apart from the Lactose1 test problem, where it 
has similar performance to ParEGO. Notably, NSGA-II 
requires less time per iteration (Table S1), but requires 
significantly more iterations to improve the hypervolume, 
and often fails to identify the complete trade-off curve in a 
practical 
number 
of 
experiments. 
Thus, 
surrogate 
model-based 
approaches 
are 
more 
suitable 
for 
expensive-to-evaluate problems. 
▪ With the exception of NSGA-II, all algorithms exhibit a 
comparable performance for test problems SNAr2 and PK1 
after 60 experiments. Convergence of the algorithms on the 
Pareto front in less than 60 experiments suggests that these 
test problems are solved more easily. In general, ParEGO and 
EIM-EGO plateau at the maximum hypervolume in a lower 
number of experiments. 
▪ The TSEMO and BS-TSEMO algorithms have a very similar 
performance based on the median and interquartile range of 
the hypervolume after 60 function evaluations. However, a 
notable difference occurs for the VdV1, SNAr2 and PK1 test 
problems, where the increase in hypervolume after the initial 
dataset is slower for BS-TSEMO. This can be attributed to the 
surrogate models been updated less frequently with new 
data when operating in batch sequential mode. It is observed 
from the results that this has a negative impact on algorithm 
performance 
in cases where the Pareto front 
is 
non-uniformly distributed. Therefore, although operating in 
batch sequential mode offers advantages in terms of 
reducing the overall self-optimisation time, this can lead to 
sub-optimal results.

▪ TSEMO was found to outperform ParEGO and NSGA-II in 5 
out of 6 test problems. This is in agreement with previous 
benchmarking studies using mathematical test functions, 
where it outperformed ParEGO and NSGA-II in 6 out of 8 
cases.28 
▪ ParEGO produces a large range of hypervolumes in 3 of the 
6 test problems (Lactose1, PK1, PK2), indicating that ParEGO 
is less robust compared to the other algorithms. ParEGO 
combines the objective functions linearly with random 
weightings. Therefore, this randomness could cause a spread 
in the results, which is emphasised in cases where the Pareto 
front is convex or discontinuous.  
▪ EIM-EGO outperforms the other algorithms on 4 of the 6 test 
problems (VdV1, Lactose1, PK1, PK2) based on the median of 
the 
hypervolume 
after 
60 
function 
evaluations. 
Furthermore, the increase in hypervolume is significantly 
faster after the initial dataset compared to TSEMO for the 
VdV1 and PK2 test problems. This is likely caused by an 
increased emphasis on exploitation when using an expected 
improvement matrix compared to Thompson sampling.  
▪ TSEMO outperforms EIM-EGO on test problems with 3 
objectives (SNAr1 and SNAr2). This difference suggests that 
using an acquisition function which maximises hypervolume 
improvement is more efficient than one which maximises the 
Euclidean distance for problems with 3 objectives.

To validate the use of the MOOA reaction simulator for 
identifying the best algorithm to use for reaction optimisation, 
we compared the performance of TSEMO and EIM-EGO on a 
three-objective 
experimental 
optimisation, 
with 
the 
expectation that TSEMO would outperform EIM-EGO. 
Experimental Comparison 
Methyl phenyl sulfide can be oxidised by hydrogen peroxide to 
the sulfoxide and subsequently to the sulfone in continuous 
flow (Figure 4). Often the sulfone is an undesired side product 
of this reaction, for example, the oxidation of sulfur mustard 
forms the significantly less hazardous sulfoxide, but this can be 
further oxidised to form the highly toxic sulfone.34 Often the 
solution for selective oxidation is to use a catalyst, or to conduct 
the reaction in a polar protic solvent.35–37 Herein, we focus on 
the optimisation of methyl phenyl sulfide conversion, selectivity 
and space-time-yield (STY) using temperature, residence time 
and equivalents of H2O2 compared to the sulfide as reaction 
variables. 
The experimental study was performed on a flow platform using 
an inline UV detector for residence time studies and a GCMS 
fitted with an automated liquid samplier for determining 
conversion and selectivity. (Figure 4). In detail, reagents were 
pumped using JASCO PU2080 and PU2085 dual piston HPLC 
pumps and pump streams were mixed using Swagelok SS-100-3 
tee-pieces. A tubular reactor of desired volume was fitted to an 
aluminium cylinder heated by heating cartridges controlled by 
a Eurotherm 980. Sampling was achieved using a Shimadzu 
Flowcell, from which the AOC 6000 auto sampler extracts a 
volume of 0.5 μL. The reactor was maintained under the desired 
fixed back pressure using an Upchurch Scientific psi back 
pressure regulator. Polyflon PTFE tubing (1/16” OD, 1/32” ID) 
was used throughout the reactor. Quantitative analysis was 
performed on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 SE instrument fitted 
with a SH-Rxi-5Sil MS column (30 m length, 2.5 mm ID and 2.5 
μm film thickness), α,α,α-trifluorotoluene (3FB) was included as 
an internal standard.   
Ideal plug flow could be assumed as characterisation via 
residence time distribution experiments found Bodenstein 
numbers to be above 100 (SI section 3.3).38 Additionally, a time 
equivalent of 1.5 reactor volumes was allowed to elapse before 
sampling.39 Flow rates, reaction temperature and sampling 
were monitored by the MATLAB interface, which used the 
calibrated mass spectrum peak areas for analysis, with either 
the TSEMO or EIM-EGO algorithm to calculate the next reaction 
setting. For EIM-EGO the Euclidean distance-based function was 
chosen as the acquisition function to conform to the prior 
simulations. More experimental details can be found in the SI.

oxidation to methyl phenyl sulfoxide, 2, and successively methyl phenyl sulfone, 3. The 
dilution is added allowing direct sampling to the GCMS.  Samples are taken by an

Both algorithms were initialised by a test set of 15 experiments 
created by the MATLAB LHC function with 1000 iterations for an 
optimal 
distribution 
of 
experiments. 
Additionally, 
reproducibility was tested by repeating one experimental 
condition six times during the optimisation. Two of those

experiments were added to the initial test set. Conversion, 
selectivity and STY could be reproduced with less than 5% 
deviation (Figure S10 SI). 
TSEMO and EIM-EGO both ran 35 single experiment iterations.  
The optimisation experimental results are shown in Figure 5.  
Figure 5. Overview of TSEMO and EIMEGO optimisations. Results show dependence of 
STY, of the formation of methyl phenyl sulfoxide and the conversion of methyl phenyl 
sulfide on temperature, residence time and hydrogen peroxide equiv.  
 
The optimisations found an optimal region at temperatures 
above 115 °C, residence times around 6.5 minutes and H2O2 
equivalents of around 2.5.  Not plotted is the selectivity because 
in 2/3 of the optimisation experiments selectivities of over 90 % 
were observed. A full overview of all parameter and objective 
relations can be found in the SI. Our results agree with literature 
showing equivalent ratios of 2.5 as optimal for highly selective 
formation of sulfoxide at medium temperatures.37,40 An 
explanation can be potentially found in mechanistic studies 
describing the O-O bond breaking as rate limiting and often 
stabilized by water.41,42  
 
Figure 6. Approximated Pareto front and experimental data near it. Conversion, 
Selectivity and STY of 2 were optimised against each other.  
 
Hence, the equivalence could be a summation of water and 
hydrogen peroxide molarity in the solution (0.8 M H2O2 and the 
usually neglected ~0.3 M water).  
Based on both algorithms a Pareto front for the 2-dimensional 
correlation between conversion and selectivity can be easily 
visually depicted (Figure 6). For the approximation in 
3-dimensional space compare with Figure S14 in the SI. 
The results detail correlation between all three optimisation 
goals and optimisation trade-offs. Therefore, reducing 
experimental load and speculation compared to traditional 
experimental approaches. Both algorithms found similar results 
regarding optima, but their speed and approach in covering the 
most hypervolume varied. 
TSEMO optimised for the maximum hypervolume faster and 
more effectively (Figure 7). Looking at the iteration steps 
following the initial test set, (SI, section 4) a more risk-taking 
approach can be distinguished. While EIMEGO initially stayed 
close to already found optima at average conditions, TSEMO 
tested more extreme points closer to the boundaries faster.  
Figure 7. Change of hypervolume for TSEMO and EIMEGO throughout the optimisations.  
 
These experimental results support the theoretically found 
results of TSEMO being superior to EIMEGO for a 3-objective 
problem.  
Conclusions 
The efficiency of self-optimisation can be directly related to the 
choice of optimisation algorithm. Therefore, it is important to 
keep self-optimising systems up to date with the latest 
advances in computer science. A method to compare the 
performance of multi-objective optimisation algorithms for the 
self-optimisation of chemical reactions was developed using a 
kinetic-based reaction simulator. The simulator included six 
chemistry-inspired test problems, each representing different 
types of reactions and possessing Pareto fronts with different 
properties. This approach was used to compare five different 
MOOAs, and identify which algorithm was best for each type of 
test problem. All Bayesian optimisation algorithms succeeded in 
finding an optimum quickly compared to NSGA-II, which can be 
considered less favourable for expensive to evaluate problems. 
EIM-EGO was in all cases the fastest, apart from for 3 objective

optimisations, for which TSEMO was better. The oxidation of 
methyl phenyl sulfide by hydrogen peroxide was therefore 
optimised for conversion, selectivity and space time yield of 
meythl phenyl sulfoxide using the two different algorithms. 
Both algorithms deepened the understanding of this reaction, 
revealing correlations and limitations of the reaction 
parameters with respect to the optimisation goals. The 
simulations and experimental case study both favoured TSEMO 
over EIM-EGO in succeeding in finding an optima in the shortest 
time. We propose this is due to a small difference in the 
optimization of exploration over exploitation. The outcome was 
in agreement with predictions made from prior simulations, 
thus demonstrating the usefulness of the multi-objective 
reaction simulator. Future work will focus on expanding the 
capabilities of the reaction simulator to encompass a wider 
range of more complex chemical examples (catalytic cycles etc.) 
The question, which algorithm to choose cannot be answered 
universally, the presented approach can however predetermine 
in silico the most suitable one for a specific challenge. Thus 
increasing 
the 
efficiency 
of 
subsequent 
experimental 
optimisations.
