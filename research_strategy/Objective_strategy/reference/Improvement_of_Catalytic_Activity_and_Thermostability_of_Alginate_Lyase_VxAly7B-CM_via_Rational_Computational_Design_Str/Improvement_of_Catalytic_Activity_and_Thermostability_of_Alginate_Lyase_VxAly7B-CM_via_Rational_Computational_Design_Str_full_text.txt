Abstract: Alginate lyase degrades alginate through the β-elimination mechanism to pro-
duce alginate oligosaccharides (AOS) with notable biochemical properties and diverse
biological activities. However, its poor thermostability limits large-scale industrial pro-
duction. In this study, we employed a rational computational design strategy combin-
ing computer-aided evolutionary coupling analysis and ∆∆Gfold evaluation to enhance
both the thermostability and catalytic activity of the alginate lyase VxAly7B-CM. Among
ten single-point mutants, the E188N and S204G mutants exhibited increases in Tm from
47.0 ◦C to 48.9 ◦C and 50.2 ◦C, respectively, with specific activities of 3701.02 U/mg and
2812.01 U/mg at 45 ◦C. Notably, the combinatorial mutant E188N/S204G demonstrated a
∆Tm of 5 ◦C and an optimal reaction temperature up to 50 ◦C, where its specific activity
reached 3823.80 U/mg—a 31% increase. Moreover, its half-life at 50 ◦C was 38.4 h, which
is 7.0 times that of the wild-type enzyme. Protein structural analysis and molecular dy-
namics simulations suggested that the enhanced catalytic performance and thermostability
of the E188N/S204G mutant may be attributed to optimized surface charge distribution,
strengthened hydrophobic interactions, and increased tertiary structure stability. Overall,
our findings provided valuable insights into enzyme stabilization strategies and supported
the industrial production of functional AOS.

1. Introduction
Alginate, an important marine polysaccharide, exhibits unique physicochemical prop-
erties and bioactivities, showing broad prospects in food, pharmaceuticals, industrial
biotechnology, and renewable energy. Alginate is a linear anionic polysaccharide com-
posed of β-D-mannuronic acid (M) and its C5-epimer α-L-guluronic acid (G) linked by

1–4 glycosidic bonds [1]. Alginate oligosaccharides (AOS), degraded products of algi-
nate with a degree of polymerization (DP) of 2–25, display superior solubility, enhanced
bioavailability, improved bioactivity, and more consistent product quality [2,3]. Numerous
studies have demonstrated that AOS possess various biological activities, including blood
glucose-lowering, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, and antitumor proper-
ties [4–7]. GV-971 (sodium oligomannate) was conditionally approved in China in 2019.
Its active ingredient is an alginate oligosaccharide—oligomeric β-1→4 D-mannuronic
acid sodium—which ameliorates mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease by reshaping the
gut microbiota and inhibiting neuroinflammation [8]. Furthermore, AOS have also been
demonstrated to possess prebiotic activity [9].
Enzymatic catalysis is currently the predominant method for producing functional
AOS. Alginate lyases selectively degrade alginate through the β-elimination mechanism,
cleaving 1,4-glycosidic bonds and forming a double bond between C4 and C5 at the nonre-
ducing end, yielding unsaturated alginate oligosaccharides (UAOS) [10]. The presence of
the unsaturated bonds endows UAOS with distinctive bioactivities, such as lipid-lowering
and immunomodulatory effects [11,12]. Moreover, the unsaturated monosaccharides
can be converted—either enzymatically or nonenzymatically—into 4-deoxy-L-erythro-5-
hexoseulose uronate (DEH). DEH is then reduced by the enzyme DehR to form 2-keto-3-
deoxygluconate (KDG), which enters the Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway to yield ethanol.
In this manner, UAOS serve as a valuable carbon source for bioethanol production and
biorefining [13,14].
Alginate lyases have been discovered, cloned, and characterized from a broad array of
sources—including brown algae, marine and soil microorganisms, marine invertebrates,
Chlorella viruses, and fungi [15]. Based on substrate specificity, alginate lyases are catego-
rized into polyM-specific enzymes (EC 4.2.2.3), polyG-specific enzymes (EC 4.2.2.11), and
bifunctional enzymes (EC 4.2.2.-) [16]. According to their mode of action, alginate lyases
are classified as either endo-type or exo-type. Endo-type lyases cleave glycosidic bonds
randomly in the alginate polymer, resulting in unsaturated oligosaccharides with a DP of
2–6, while exo-type lyases only produce monosaccharides or disaccharides by gradation
from the end of the alginate molecule [17]. In the Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes Database,
alginate lyases are categorized into polysaccharide lyase families (PL) 5, 6, 7, 8, 14, 15, 17,
18, 31, 32, 34, 36, 39, and 41 [18].
In industrial production, the enzymatic degradation of seaweed biomass is typically
conducted at temperatures of 50 ◦C or higher. Such conditions enhance the solubility of
polysaccharides, reduce viscosity, and improve enzyme accessibility to the substrate, thus
accelerating the reaction rate [19]. Additionally, high temperatures help inhibit microbial
contamination, ensuring greater process stability [20]. Utilizing thermostable alginate
lyases allows for continuous high-temperature operations, reduces cooling energy require-
ments, and ultimately boosts the degradation efficiency. However, most alginate lyases
originate from marine environments, exhibiting peak activity at low temperatures and
being prone to high-temperature inactivation, with half-lives at 50 ◦C usually under 10 h
due to insufficient thermostability [21–23]. For example, the alginate lyase aly-SJ02, isolated
from Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM0524, exhibited peak activity at 50 ◦C, with a half-life of
41 min at 40 ◦C and 20 min at 50 ◦C [24]. The PL7 family enzyme Aly7B_Wf retained 86.5%
and 75.5% of its activity after 24 h at 25 ◦C and 35 ◦C, respectively, but rapidly lost stability
above 40 ◦C, retaining only about 40% activity after 6 h at 50 ◦C [25]. These heat-sensitive
properties severely hinder the efficiency of alginate lyases in industrial AOS production, un-
derscoring the urgent need to enhance their thermal stability through protein engineering
and other innovative approaches.

In our group’s previous research, the alginate lyase VxAly7B, derived from Vibrio
xiamenensis QY104, was demonstrated to have excellent alginate degradation ability [26].
VxAly7B contained an N-terminal carbohydrate-binding module (CBM32) and a C-terminal
catalytic module (PL7). Experimental data indicated that the presence of CBM32 reduced
the enzyme’s thermal stability; when only the catalytic module was retained, the enzyme
(VxAly7B-CM) adopted a more compact three-dimensional structure, leading to a marked
improvement in heat resistance. In this study, we aim to further enhance the thermal
stability of VxAly7B-CM through an effective combinatorial strategy that merges evolution-
ary coupling analysis and ∆∆Gfold evaluation. The combinatorial mutant E188N/S204G
demonstrated remarkable improvements in both catalytic activity and thermal stability.
Additionally, multiple sequence alignments, structural analysis, and molecular dynamics
simulations were performed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the im-
proved thermal stability of the mutant. This work provided an effective strategy for protein
engineering modifications.
2. Results
2.1. Rational Design of Mutants
To improve the catalytic performance of the alginate lyase VxAly7B-CM, the protein
sequence was first submitted to the EVcouplings web server for evolutionary coupling
analysis and assessment of mutation epistatic effects (Figure 1a) [27]. Mutations exhibiting
epistatic effect values >0 (indicative of beneficial substitutions) were selected as the basis
for rational design. The negative value of ∆∆Gfold typically indicates enhanced protein
stability [28]. The FireProt web server was utilized to predict the ∆∆Gfold values of the
mutants (Figure 1b), with a selection threshold of ∆∆Gfold < −0.5 kcal/mol [29]. A total of
10 mutants that met the above criteria were prioritized for further investigation, including
E188D, E188N, S194M, S204G, Q214S, S296L, K368D, V370I, H375K, and A384G. The
mutation epistatic effects and ∆∆Gfold values of these mutants are listed in Table S1.

The positions of the mutated amino acid residues in the three-dimensional structure
of VxAly7B-CM, along with their respective evolutionary conservation grades, are shown
in Figure 2. All mutation sites were located on the surface of the protein structure, far
from the catalytic active sites and substrate-binding pocket. Except for the V370 site, the
other eight sites were in low-conservation regions, indicating that the designed point
mutation strategy largely avoided interference with the enzyme’s catalytic function [30].
All mutants were successfully expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) with the correct molecular
weight (approximately 33.0 kDa) (Figure S2).

acid residues were color-coded according to the conservation grades, with the mutated amino acid
residues highlighted in stick models.
2.2. Biochemical Characterization of VxAly7B-CM and Its Mutants
The specific activities and the melting temperature (Tm) of the wild-type VxAly7B-CM
(WT) and its mutants are shown in Table 1. Among all mutants, the E188N mutant exhibited
a significant enhancement in catalytic activity, reaching 3701.02 U/mg—1.26 times that
of the WT. E188D and S204G mutants maintained relative activities of 103% and 95%,
respectively. Although the other variants showed various degrees of activity loss, each
retained over 65%, with none being completely inactivated. The Tm values for the E188D,
E188N, S204G, S296L, K368D, and V370I increased to various extents compared with the
WT. Among these, the S204G mutant exhibited the highest Tm, reaching 50.2 ◦C, with a
∆Tm of 3.2 ◦C. E188N attained a Tm of 48.9 ◦C, ranking second only to S204G.

According to Figure 3a, the WT reached its maximum activity at 45 ◦C, but its perfor-
mance dropped rapidly at higher temperatures. Mutants H375K and A384G shifted their
optimum to 40 ◦C, while all other variants maintained a peak at 45 ◦C, consistent with the
WT. Remarkably, both E188N and S204G exhibited over 87% of their maximum activity at
50 ◦C, showing high-temperature adaptability.

optimal temperature of VxAly7B-CM and its mutants; (b) the thermal stability of VxAly7B-CM and
its mutants at 45 ◦C; (c) the thermal stability of VxAly7B-CM and its mutants at 50 ◦C.
Further assessment of thermal stability was conducted by monitoring enzyme activity
retention at 45 ◦C over incubation periods of 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 28, 32, and 36 h (Figure 3b). The
S204G variant demonstrated the slowest rate of inactivation, maintaining 78.6% and 57.1%
activity at 24 and 36 h, respectively. Likewise, E188N and S296L also exhibited a significant
improvement in thermal stability within 36 h. In contrast, the A384G variant experienced
a rapid decline to 42.0% activity within 8 h, and the stabilities of S194M and H375K also
deteriorated significantly after 12 h, with activities remaining below the WT. These results
are also highly consistent with the Tm values.
Based on the above findings, mutants showing significant improvements in thermal
stability (E188D, E188N, S204G, S296L, K368D, and V370I) were selected for further charac-
terization. In the accelerated stability test at 50 ◦C (Figure 3c), the S204G variant exhibited
exceptional thermal stability by retaining 60% of its activity after 6 h, considerably outper-
forming the WT and the other variants, which retained less than 46%. The E188N and V370I
mutants also conferred improved stability at 50 ◦C. Notably, E188N not only exhibited a
marked enhancement in catalytic activity but also improved thermal stability at both 45 ◦C
and 50 ◦C. In a word, while S204G preserved robust stability without substantial activity

loss, E188N enhanced both catalytic performance and thermal resilience. Consequently, we
constructed the combined mutant E188N/S204G to further optimize modification effects.
2.3. Optimal Temperature and Thermal Stability of VxAly7B-CM and the Mutant E188N/S204G
As shown in Figure 4a, the optimal reaction temperature for the E188N/S204G mutant
was shifted to 50 ◦C, where its activity reaches 3823.80 U/mg, a 33% increase compared
to the WT, and slightly higher than that of the E188N mutant. Moreover, at 52 ◦C, the
E188N/S204G variant maintained 71% of its activity, whereas the WT retains only 32%. The
Tm of the E188N/S204G variant was the highest among all mutants, reaching 52.0 ◦C—an
increase of 5 ◦C—revealing a marked improvement in structural stability.

the mutant E188N/S204G at 50 ◦C.
Under incubation at 45 ◦C (Figure 4b), both the WT and the mutant E188N/S204G
retained high activity during the initial phase (0–4 h). However, the WT activity declined
rapidly, dropping to 67% after 12 h, while E188N/S204G showed a much slower decrease,
retaining about 64% activity after 36 h. Under incubation at 50 ◦C (Figure 4c), the stability
disparity between WT and E188N/S204G became even more pronounced: E188N/S204G
exhibited a half-life (t1/2) of 38.4 h—7.0-fold that of the WT (t1/2 = 5.5 h). These results
underscore the high-temperature application potential of the E188N/S204G mutant in
alginate degradation.
2.4. Analysis of Degradation Products
VxAly7B-CM was an endo-type alginate lyase that generated various sizes of unsatu-
rated oligosaccharides at the early stages of the reaction, with the degradation products
primarily consisting of high-molecular-weight sugar chains (Figure 5a). As the reaction
progressed, the proportion of smaller oligosaccharides (∆DP2 and ∆DP3) gradually in-
creased. As shown in Figure 5b, the mutations did not alter the degradation pattern of the
enzyme. In addition, final degradation products were analyzed by FPLC (Figure 5c,d) and
negative ion ESI-MS (Figure S3). FPLC separation results showed that the final degradation
products of WT and the E188N/S204G mutant were ∆DP2, ∆DP3, ∆DP4, and ∆DP5, with
the same molar ratios of 2.26:1.96:1.35:1.

2.5. Surface Charge and Hydrophobic Distribution of Proteins
Optimizing the electrostatic charge distribution on the enzyme surface not only en-
hances its thermal stability but also promotes enzyme–substrate binding, improving cat-
alytic efficiency [31–33]. As depicted in Figure 6a, substituting Ser204 with Gly204 did not
significantly alter the local charge properties, as both residues are neutral. Interestingly,
replacing Glu188 with Asn188 markedly reduced the local negative charge. Structurally, the
side chain of Glu residue carries a negatively charged carboxyl group (-COOH), whereas
Asn residue features a polar amide group (-CONH2); this change diminished the negative
charge at position 188. The replacement of Ser204 with Gly204 increased the hydrophobicity
of the affected region due to the simpler side chain of the Gly residue, which lacks the polar
hydroxyl group present in the Ser residue, thereby promoting the formation of a more
compact and stable folded structure (Figure 6b) [34,35].
2.6. Analysis of Protein Intramolecular Interaction
Analysis of intramolecular interactions in both WT and the mutant E188N/S204G
proteins revealed significant alterations upon substituting Ser204 with Gly204, as depicted
in Figure 7a,b. In the WT, Ser204 formed hydrogen bonds with neighboring residues
Leu201 and Ala203, and also engaged in polar interactions with Ala200 and Ala203. In the
E188N/S204G, Gly204 formed hydrogen bonds with Ser172 and Leu201, and the average
bond length decreased from 2.6 Å to 2.4 Å. Meanwhile, Gly204 formed new polar bonds
with Pro170, Ser172, Ser202, and Glu206. Analysis of the secondary structure of VxAly7B-
CM revealed that, compared to Ser204, which interacted only with residues within the

α1 helix, Gly204 formed stronger hydrogen bonds and additional polar interactions with
residues in both the η1 helix (310 helix) and the α1 helix (Figure 7c). Gly204 likely stabilized
the structures of these two flexible helices and enhanced their connection [36,37].

2.7. MD Simulations Analysis
To systematically evaluate the structural stability, a 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation was performed under 323 K conditions. As shown in Figure 8a, the backbone
RMSD of WT rose from ~0.9 Å at 0 ns to ~1.6 Å, then fluctuated between 1.0 and 1.7 Å from
20 to 100 ns, indicating substantial conformational deviations over the course of the simula-
tion. In contrast, E188N/S204G maintained a narrower RMSD range (~0.9–1.4 Å), with a
smoother curve and reduced amplitude of fluctuation, demonstrating enhanced structural
integrity and a more compact backbone organization under elevated temperature [38]. The
RMSF profiles for both the mutant and WT exhibited similar overall trends, likely due to
the inherent stability of VxAly7B-CM, rendering minor stability enhancements less dis-
cernible (Figure 8b) [39]. Nevertheless, the RMSF curve of E188N/S204G was consistently
below that of WT, especially at peak positions like residues 185–190, 230–235, and 340–350,
suggesting smaller residue fluctuations. In conclusion, mutant E188N/S204G had a highly
rigid and more stable protein structure.

values of VxAly7B-CM and E188N/S204G during 100 ns MD simulations at 323 K; (b) RMSF values

VxAly7B-CM and E188N/S204G during 100 ns MD simulations at 323 K.
Solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) measures the area of a molecule’s surface that
is accessible to solvent (typically water). During protein folding, hydrophobic residues
tend to be buried in the protein core, thereby reducing their SASA and enhancing overall
stability [40]. As shown in Figure 8c, the average SASA of the E188N/S204G mutant was
lower than that of WT. In particular, around residue 204, the SASA decreased markedly
upon mutation, indicating that the side chains in this region relocated into the protein
interior. This observation was consistent with the local hydrophobicity increase conferred
by the S204G mutation described in Section 2.5—in other words, the S204G mutation drove
nearby residues inward, strengthened hydrophobic packing, minimized unfavorable water
contacts, and improved protein stability. A similar decrease in SASA was also observed at
residue 188.

3. Discussion
In this study, we implemented a computational-aided engineering strategy combining
evolutionary coupling analysis and ∆∆Gfold prediction to simultaneously improve the
catalytic activity and thermostability of alginate lyase VxAly7B-CM. Among the engineered
variants, E188N demonstrated a 26% activity enhancement alongside superior thermosta-
bility, whereas S204G achieved marked thermal stabilization without catalytic trade-offs.
The combinatorial mutant E188N/S204G exhibited an enzymatic activity of 3823.80 U/mg
and a half-life of 38.4 h at 50 ◦C, surpassing most reported alginate lyases in both catalytic
efficiency and thermal endurance.
Balancing catalytic efficiency and thermal stability remains challenging in enzyme
engineering [41,42]. Improving an enzyme’s thermal stability often necessitates a com-
prehensive understanding of its sequence conservation, three-dimensional structure, and
catalytic mechanism to prevent performance loss. For instance, to enhance the thermal
stability of the alginate lyase cAlyM through the introduction of disulfide bonds with-
out compromising enzymatic activity, Yang et al. performed analyses of catalytic sites,
secondary structures, spatial proximities, and 3D structural flexibility to identify suitable
candidate mutations [43]. Based on detailed analyses of the E226K-PM4 binding mode
in prereaction-state MD simulation and subsequent three rounds of mutagenesis, Su et al.
reengineered the flexible loops and substrate entrance of the catalytic cavity in the PL18
alginate lyase E226K, increasing the half-life at 45 ◦C from 89 min to 557 min [44].
In protein evolution, residues that interact—especially those close in space or func-
tionally interdependent—often coevolve to preserve structure and activity [45]. Unlike
most computational methods that assess each position independently (independent model),
EVcouplings can capture dependencies between residues (epistatic model) [46,47]. By com-
bining single-site conservation with pairwise coupling constraints, EVcouplings provides a
more comprehensive evaluation of mutation effects. Research had shown that the correla-
tion between the computed ∆E of the epistatic model and experimental measurements of
phenotype was more significant than that of the independent model [48].
In this study, EVcouplings was applied to predict evolutionary beneficial mutations,
thereby reducing the risk of disrupting key functional interactions. Subsequently, ∆∆Gfold
calculations were used to screen for mutations that significantly enhance structural stability.
Our experimental results indicated that the ten mutations satisfying the criteria of epistatic
effects >0 and ∆∆Gfold < −0.5 kcal/mol were all located on the protein surface, distant
from catalytic active sites and substrate-binding pockets, and exhibited low conservation.
Although some variants showed varying degrees of activity loss, each retained over 65%
activity, possibly due to evolutionary coupling analysis effectively avoiding perturbations of
key functional residues. Notably, E188N exhibited enhanced thermostability (∆Tm = 1.9 ◦C)
with a 26% higher specific activity than the wild-type enzyme. S204G preserved robust
stability without substantial activity loss. These findings suggested that the integration
of the EVcouplings tool with ∆∆Gfold calculations can enhance both structural integrity
and functional performance of proteins—even in the absence of detailed prior knowledge
regarding enzyme architectures or catalytic mechanisms. It provides a straightforward yet
effective strategy with broad applicability across diverse protein systems.
Docking simulations with a tetrasaccharide substrate [4-deoxy-L-erythro-hex-4-ene-
pyranosyluronate-(mannuronate)(2)-mannuronic acid] revealed that position 188, while not
directly involved in substrate binding or located within the catalytic pocket, was situated at
the entrance of the catalytic cavity (Figure 6a). In the WT, the pronounced negative charge
at the entrance may impede the entry of similarly negatively charged substrates due to
electrostatic repulsion. While the E188N mutation diminished the negative charge at the
entrance, potentially facilitating substrate access and enhancing catalytic activity [49,50].

In the E188N/S204G mutant, substituting Ser204 with Gly204 eliminated the polar
hydroxyl group from the side chain, increasing local hydrophobicity and promoting the
inward movement of adjacent residues to enhance hydrophobic core packing—factors
crucial for improving protein thermostability. Additionally, Gly204 formed stronger in-
teractions with neighboring residues and acted as a linker between the η1 and α1 helical
structures. This connectivity likely contributed to stabilizing flexible helices, reducing their
susceptibility to distortion under elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the absence of a
side chain in Gly reduced steric hindrance, increasing regional flexibility. From a dynamic
perspective, those changes allowed the η1 and α1 helices to coordinate more effectively
during protein folding or functional motion, minimizing conformational conflicts and
enhancing overall stability [51,52]. Therefore, we speculated that the multi-optimization
of local charge distribution, intramolecular interaction, and three-dimensional structure
conformation enabled the E188N/S204G mutant to maintain high catalytic efficiency over
extended periods at elevated temperatures.
In conclusion, the superior enzymatic performance and thermal stability of the
E188N/S204G mutant established a solid foundation for its application in AOS production.
Furthermore, the rational design strategy employed in this study provided valuable insights
and a versatile methodology for engineering other thermosensitive enzymes, broadening
the scope of protein engineering for industrial biotechnology.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Bacterial Strains and Chemicals
The recombinant plasmid pET24a(+)-VxAly7B-CM utilized in this study was main-
tained in our laboratory and transformed into E. coli JM109 for amplification. The domain
organization and amino acid numbering of VxAly7B-CM are shown in Figure S1. For
the expression of VxAly7B-CM and its mutants, an expression system was established
using E. coli BL21 (DE3) as the host strain. The molecular biology reagents used in this
study were obtained from commercial sources, including the TIANGEN Biotech plasmid
extraction kit (Beijing, China), the ToYoBo KOD One™PCR Master Mix (Beijing, China),
the OMEGA Bio-tek DNA gel extraction kit (Guangzhou, China), and the Novoprotein
homologous recombination kit (Suzhou, China). Sodium alginate was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), and all other chemicals were of analytical grade and
commercially available.
4.2. Mutation Site Selection and Construction
4.2.1. Rational Design of Candidate Mutants
The VxAly7B-CM protein sequence was submitted to the AlphaFold 3 online
server (https://deepmind.google/technologies/alphafold/alphafold-server/, accessed
on 25 September 2024) for three-dimensional structural prediction. The model quality was
further assessed using the SAVES 6.0 (Verify3D tool) online server (https://saves.mbi.
ucla.edu/, accessed on 25 September 2024) [53]. The EVcouplings web server was used
to evaluate the effect of mutations. Based on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of
numerous homologous sequences, EVcouplings constructs the Potts model with regular-
ized maximum pseudolikelihood to identify single-site constraints and pairwise coupling
constraints, calculating the mutation epistatic effects [48]. Using the FireProt 2.0 web
server (https://loschmidt.chemi.muni.cz/fireprotweb/,accessed on 9 October 2024), the
three-dimensional structure of VxAly7B-CM was analyzed with FoldX to predict ∆∆Gfold
values based on the calculation of the empirical force field [54]. GraphPad Prism 8.0
was utilized to visualize the anticipated effects of these mutations. The Consurf server

(https://consurf.tau.ac.il/, accessed on 21 October 2024) was employed to analyze the
conservation of amino acid residues based on multiple sequence alignment.
4.2.2. Construction of Mutants by Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted using the plasmid pET24a(+)-VxAly7B-CM
as the template, with mutation-specific primers detailed in Table S2. The amplified PCR
products were digested with the restriction enzyme Dpn I to eliminate the methylated
template plasmid, followed by Gibson recombination and transformed into E. coli JM109.
Single colonies were selected and cultured overnight in Luria–Bertani (LB) solid medium
containing 30 µg/mL kanamycin sulfate. The plasmids were extracted for DNA sequencing.
Primer synthesis and DNA sequencing services were provided by Tsingke Biotechnology
Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China).
4.2.3. Expression and Purification of VxAly7B-CM and Its Mutants
The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for protein expres-
sion. A single colony was inoculated into 5 mL of LB liquid medium containing 30 µg/mL
kanamycin sulfate and incubated at 37 ◦C for 8 h. This culture was then diluted 1:100
into fresh LB medium with the same antibiotic concentration and incubated at 37 ◦C with
shaking at 220 rpm until the OD600 reached 0.4–0.6. Protein expression was induced by
adding isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 100 µM,
followed by incubation at 18 ◦C with shaking at 160 rpm for 24 h.
The recombinant VxAly7B-CM and its mutants, each containing a C-terminal (His)6
tag, were purified using a HisTrap HP chromatography column (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences, Piscataway, USA). The protein storage buffer consisted of 20 mM phosphate
buffer (PB) at pH 7.6, supplemented with 500 mM NaCl. To remove unbound proteins,
the column was washed with buffer containing 25 mM imidazole, and the target proteins
were eluted with buffer containing 100 mM imidazole. The purity and molecular weight of
the proteins were assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) on a 12% (w/v) resolving gel. Protein concentrations were determined using
the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) [55].
4.3. Biochemical Characterization of VxAly7B-CM and Its Mutants
4.3.1. Enzyme Activity Assay
Enzyme activity was assessed using the A235 method, which monitors the increase
in absorbance at 235 nm resulting from the formation of unsaturated double bonds in the
degradation products [56]. The reaction mixture (1 mL) consisted of 100 µL of appropriately
diluted enzyme solution and 900 µL of pre-warmed substrate solution [0.3% (w/v) alginate
substrate, 20 mM PB, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.6]. The reaction was conducted at 45 ◦C for
10 min, and absorbance changes at 235 nm were recorded. One unit (U) of enzyme activity
was defined as the amount of enzyme required to increase the absorbance at 235 nm by
0.1 per min.
4.3.2. Optimal Temperature and Thermal Stability Assay
To determine the optimum temperature, the activities of alginate lyase were measured
at various temperatures ranging from 35 to 55 ◦C. The highest observed activity was defined
as 100%, and relative activities at each temperature were calculated accordingly.
The melt temperature (Tm) values were determined using the micro-differential scan-
ning fluorometer Prometheus NT.48 (NanoTemper Technologies GmbH, Munich, Germany),
which can monitor changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan and tyrosine residues
during protein unfolding. Protein samples were diluted to a concentration of 1 mg/mL
and centrifuged at 4 ◦C at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to remove impurities. The scanning

temperature was gradually increased from 25 ◦C to 90 ◦C at a rate of 1 ◦C/min. Each
sample was measured in triplicate.
To determine the thermal inactivation half-life (t1/2), the activity of the untreated
alginate lyases served as the standard and was designated as 100%. The activities at
different times were then expressed as relative (%) values compared with the untreated
control. The data obtained were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software to calculate
t1/2.
4.4. Analysis of Degradation Product
The changes in degradation products over time were analyzed by thin-layer chro-
matography (TLC). Enzymatic hydrolysis of a 0.3% (w/v) alginate substrate was conducted
at 45 ◦C. Samples were collected at 0, 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min, then boiled for 10 min to
terminate the reaction. In this procedure, the developing solvent consisted of n-butanol,
formic acid, and water in a volumetric ratio of 4:6:1. The staining reagent was an aniline-
diphenylamine solution composed of 4 g diphenylamine, 4 mL aniline, 20 mL 85% (v/v)
phosphoric acid, and 200 mL acetone.
The final degradation products were analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography
(FPLC) and negative-ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). A 0.3% (w/v)
alginate substrate solution was supplemented with enzymes to a final concentration of 20
U/mL and incubated at 45 ◦C for 12 h to ensure complete substrate degradation, and then
terminated by boiling for 10 min. Separation was performed using a Superdex peptide
10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare, USA) with 0.2 M NH4HCO3 as the mobile phase at a
flow rate of 0.2 mL/min, monitoring absorbance changes at 235 nm by FPLC. Fractions
corresponding to the chromatographic peaks were collected, mixed in a 1:1 volume ratio
with acetonitrile, and analyzed by negative-ion ESI-MS over an m/z range of 0–1000.
Ranges without significant sample peaks are not shown.
4.5. Structural Analysis and Molecular Dynamics Simulations
4.5.1. Protein Structure Visualization and Analysis
PyMOL 2.5.0 software was used to visualize the structure of VxAly7B-CM and its
mutant, and to analyze the surface charge and hydrophilic distribution of the proteins. Dy-
naMut (https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/dynamut2/, accessed on 14 January 2025) and Discov-
ery Studio Visualizer (https://discover.3ds.com/discovery-studio-visualizer-download,
accessed on 22 April 2025) were utilized to assess inter-residue interactions within the
protein structure [57,58]. The amino acid sequence of VxAly7B-CM, along with those
of other PL7 family alginate lyases, was uploaded to Clustal Omega for multiple se-
quence alignment [59]. The alignment results were further visualized using ESPript 3.0
(https://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/cgi-bin/ESPript.cgi, accessed on 12 February 2025), and
secondary structure analysis was performed using VxAly7B-CM as the template [60].
4.5.2. Molecular Docking
The mannan tetramer (PDB: 4F13) was docked into VxAly7B-CM using AutoDock
Vina [61–63]. The docking box was set at the predicted conserved catalytic pocket, and the
top 10 binding conformations with the lowest binding free energy were selected for analysis.
4.5.3. Molecular Dynamics Simulations
To further assess the structural flexibility of the alginate lyase, molecular dynam-
ics (MD) simulations were performed using GROMACS with the Amber ff99SB force
field [64,65]. The system was solvated using the SPC/E water model. To maintain overall
charge neutrality, Na+ and Cl−ions were incorporated based on the Coulomb potential
grid. The entire system was energy-minimized using a combined steepest descent method

to eliminate unfavorable atomic contacts. The system was annealed at 318 K for 1 ns with
weak restraints applied to the protein. Once a uniform density was achieved during the
heating phase, the system was equilibrated at a target pressure of 1.0 bar. MD simulations
were then performed at 323 K and 1.0 bar for 100 ns, and the root-mean-square fluctuations
(RMSF), root-mean-square deviations (RMSD), and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA)
were calculated.
