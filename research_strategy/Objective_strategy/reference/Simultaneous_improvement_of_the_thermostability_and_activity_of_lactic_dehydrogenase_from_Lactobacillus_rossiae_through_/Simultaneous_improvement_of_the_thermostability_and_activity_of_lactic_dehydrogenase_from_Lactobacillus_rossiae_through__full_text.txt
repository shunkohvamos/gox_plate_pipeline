D-Phenyllactic acid, is a versatile organic acid with wide application prospects in the food, pharmaceutical
and material industries. Wild-type lactate dehydrogenase LrLDH from Lactobacillus rossiae exhibits a high
catalytic performance in the production of
D-phenyllactic acid from phenylpyruvic acid or sodium
phenylpyruvate, but its industrial application is hampered by poor thermostability. Here, computer aided
rational design was applied to improve the thermostability of LrLDH. By using HotSpot Wizard 3.0, ﬁve
hotspot residues (N218, L237, T247, D249 and S301) were identiﬁed, after which site-saturation
mutagenesis and combined mutagenesis were performed. The double mutant D249A/T247I was screen
out as the best variant, with optimum temperature, t1/2, and T10
50 that were 12 °C, 17.96 min and 19 °C
higher than that of wild-type LrLDH, respectively. At the same time, the kcat/Km of D249A/T247I was 1.47
s−1 mM−1, which was 3.4 times higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. Thus rational design was
successfully applied to simultaneously improve the thermostability and catalytic activity of LrLDH to
a signiﬁcant extent. The results of molecular dynamics simulations and molecular structure analysis
could explain the mechanisms for the improved performance of the double mutant. This study shows
that computer-aided rational design can greatly improve the thermostability of D-lactate dehydrogenase,
oﬀering a reference for the modiﬁcation of other enzymes.
Introduction
Currently, chemical preservatives like sodium benzoate and
potassium sorbate are widely used in the food industry. They
play important roles in preventing the proliferation of spoilage
microorganisms and food-borne pathogens, as well as reducing
the generation of harmful microbial secondary metabolites.
However, excessive or improper use of these preservatives may
cause metabolic imbalances and lead to certain diseases.1 With
increasing awareness of food safety issues, there is an urgent
need to nd safer alternatives. Phenyllactic acid (PLA), a natural
organic acid with remarkable antimicrobial properties, is found
in honey and some foods fermented by lactic acid bacteria
(LAB).2,3 Due to the well-known safety of LAB in the food
industry, the use of their metabolites, including PLA, is gener-
ally regarded as safe. By decreasing the rigidity of the cell wall
and damaging the membrane integrity, PLA has antibacterial
eﬀects against a variety of bacteria and fungi, resulting in
a
broad
antimicrobial
spectrum.4–6
Moreover,
PLA
has
prominent water solubility and excellent thermal stability while
having no objectionable odor.7,8 Due to these advantages, PLA
has great potential for use as a preservative in the food industry.
Due to the presence of a chiral carbon atom, chemical synthesis
results in the production of a mixture of D-PLA and L-PLA,
whereby the former has a better antibacterial eﬀect.9 In addi-
tion, D-PLA can be used as a building block in the synthesis of
pharmaceuticals, including the hypoglycemic agent englita-
zone, the coronary heart disease treatment drug danshensu and
the anthelmintic agent PF1022A.10–12 In addition, D-PLA can act
as a monomer to produce poly-PLA, a biodegradable material
with excellent thermostability and ultraviolet absorption prop-
erties.13 Hence, D-PLA has broad application potential in the
food, pharmaceutical and material industries, which has
attracted considerable interest in its manufacturing.
A variety of microorganisms can be used for PLA fermenta-
tion, especially LAB.14 However, although many eﬀort including
metabolic engineering and process optimization have been
made, both the output and optical purity were unsatisfac-
tory.15,16 Moreover, the excessive by-products drive up the cost,
due to the complex process of product separation. PLA is the by-
product of phenylalanine metabolism in the cells of LABs, and
phenylpyruvate (PPA) is the direct precursor of PLA. D-PLA is
generated by PPA reduction catalyzed by D-lactate dehydroge-
nase (D-LDH).17 Owing to its excellent catalytic activity and

stereoselectivity, fewer by-products and eco-friendly reaction
conditions, biocatalytic conversion is considered a more eﬃ-
cient and straightforward strategy for D-PLA production than
fermentation. Zhou et al.,18 cloned a D-LDH gene from Lacto-
bacillus sp. ZX1 and expressed it in Escherichia coli. Subse-
quently,
a
fed-batch
conversion
using
whole
cells
was
conducted, and 18.21 g l−1 D-PLA was generated from PPA
within 8 h. To improve NADH regeneration and the yield of D-
PLA, Qin et al. fusion expressed D-LDH and glycerol dehydro-
genase in E. coli. Catalyzed by this strain, a productivity of 5.83 g
l−1 h−1 was achieved in a 5 l reactor.19 In our previous work,
a gene encodes D-LDH was cloned and heterologous expressed
in E. coli. The obtained recombinant protein LrLDH has the
ability to asymmetrically reduce PPA to D-PLA with high activity,
but the half-life of LrLDH at 50 °C is only 3.70 min, indicating
poor thermostability.20 Thermostability is an important process
parameter, which reects the ability of enzyme maintain the
integrity of its structure and function at a certain temperature.
Moreover, high temperature can improve the reaction rate and
reduce the viscosity of the feed liquid.21 Therefore, the poor
thermostability of D-LDH is a serious obstacle for its application
in the production of D-PLA.
Protein engineering approaches, including directed evolu-
tion and rational design, are powerful tools for overcoming the
shortcomings of natural enzymes such as unsatisfactory ther-
mostability.22 Compared with directed evolution, rational
design based on computer-assisted techniques is more rapid
and targeted.23 This strategy is usually employed to enhance
enzyme thermostability and numerous successful examples
have been reported. Zhao et al. predicted candidate residue
pairs suitable for substitution by cysteine using the DbD
computational tool, and the additional disulde bridges were
introduced into
D-psicose-3-epimerase. Aer B-factor value
analysis and screening, three mutant enzymes were obtained
with varying degrees of improvement in optimum catalytic
temperature and half-life (t1/2).24 Based on protein surface
topography, multiple sequence alignment and calculations of
the changes in free energy of folding (DDG), hot spots related to
thermal stability of endoglucanase II from Penicillium verruco-
sum were predicted and site-specic mutagenesis were con-
ducted. The mutants showed a remarkable improvement in
thermostability without changes of specic activity.25
Under extreme conditions such as high temperature or
extreme pH, enzymatic denaturation begins with partial
unfolding of the peripheral protein chains, followed by expo-
sure of the protein interior and aggregation of the hydrophobic
regions.26 Therefore, the rigidity of the structure outside the
active center plays an important role in determining the ther-
mostability of enzymes. To improve the thermostability of
LrLDH, we engineered the enzyme using computationally
assisted rational design. The appropriate substitutions of
amino acid residues were selected with the aid of HotSpot
Wizard 3.0 (https://loschmidt.chemi.muni.cz/hotspotwizard/),
followed by site-saturation mutagenesis and combinatorial
mutations. The variant D249A/T247I with both enhanced ther-
mostability and improved catalytic activity with PPA was
obtained, and the underlying molecular mechanisms were
analyzed.
Experimental
Reagents

cleotide disodium salt (NADH), kanamycin and Ni-TED pre-
packed gravity column (5 ml) were purchased from Sangon
Biotech (Shanghai, China) Co., Ltd. Tryptone and yeast extract
were
obtained
from
Oxoid
Co.,
Ltd
(United
Kingdom).
PrimeSTAR® HS DNA polymerase, QuickCut™restriction
enzymes, PCR reagents, loading buﬀers for nucleic acid elec-
trophoresis and SDS-PAGE, DNA and protein markers, as well as
the Bradford protein assay kit were purchased from Takara
Biotechnology (Dalian, China) Co., Ltd. The plasmid miniprep
kits were purchased from Axygen Biotechnology (Hangzhou,
China) Co., Ltd. Oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing
were conducted by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China).
Unless specied otherwise, all other reagents and chemicals
used in this study were obtained from general commercial
suppliers and used without further purication.
E. coli BL21 (DE3) and pET-28a (+) were used as the host
strain and vector for protein expression. The plasmid pET28a-
lrldh with the lactic dehydrogenase gene from Lactobacillus
rossiae was used as the template for the site-saturation
mutagenesis.
The engineered E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani
(LB) medium (0.5% yeast extract, 1.0% tryptone and 1.0%
NaCl), supplemented with 50 mg ml−1 kanamycin.
Molecular modelling and docking
The three-dimensional (3D) homology models of LrLDH and its
mutants were generated using Rosetta CM based on the crystal
structure of lactic dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus helveticus
in complex with NADH (PDB ID: 2DLD) as the template. A total
of 1000 models were generated and the model with the lowest
score was used as the input structure for further calculations.
Molecular docking was then performed between LrLDH or its
variants and PPA according to the program Autodock 4.2. The
detailed parameters were set refer to the previous article.27 And
the images were created with PyMOL.
Construction of the mutant library
The 3D homology model of wild-type LrLDH was submitted to
the
HotSpot
Wizard
3.0
webserver,
and
the
potential
thermostability-related residues were predicted as described
before.28 Site-directed mutations were performed via poly-
merase chain reactions (PCR) using pET28a (+) recombinant
plasmid with wild-type or mutant lrldh genes as the template.
The primers used for the saturation mutagenesis at each site are
listed in Table 1. The PCR was performed as described previ-
ously.29 To degrade the template, the QuickCut™restriction
enzyme DpnI was added to the PCR reaction mixture and
incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The products were used to
transform E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells and cultivated on

LB agar plates containing 50 mg ml−1 kanamycin. The trans-
formants were veried by DNA sequencing.
Protein expression and purication
E. coli cells harboring recombinant plasmids encoding lrldh or
its variants were cultured in 50 ml LB medium containing 50 mg
ml−1 kanamycin at 37 °C and 180 rpm until the optical density
at 600 nm (OD600) reached approximately 0.8. Subsequently,
lactose was added as an inducer to a nal concentration of 10 g
l−1, and the cultures were cultured at 28 °C and 150 rpm for
another 12 h. The cells were harvested by centrifuged at 4 °C
and 8000×g for 10 min, washed twice with potassium phos-
phate buﬀer (20 mM, pH 8.0), resuspended in the same buﬀer
with a wet cell concentration of 50 g l−1, and disrupted by
ultrasonication (300 W, 10 min) in an ice bath followed by
centrifugation (10 000×g, 4 °C, 20 min) to remove the cell
debris. The supernatants were collected and loaded onto a 5 ml
Ni-TED pre-packed gravity column pre-equilibrated with buﬀer
A (20 mM imidazole and 500 mM NaCl in 20 mM potassium
phosphate buﬀer, pH 8.0), and washed with 25 ml buﬀer A to
remove the unbound proteins. The fractions were collected by
elution with buﬀer B (500 mM imidazole and 500 mM NaCl in
20 mM potassium phosphate buﬀer, pH 8.0) and dialyzed
overnight against potassium phosphate buﬀer (20 mM, pH 8.0).
All purication steps were conducted at 0–4 °C. The purity of the
target protein was checked by SDS-PAGE with a 12% acrylamide
separating gel under denaturing conditions. The concentration
of puried enzymes was measured using the Bradford protein
assay kit with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the protein
standard.
Enzyme activity assay
The enzymatic activity of wild-type LrLDH and its mutants was
measured at 30 °C by monitoring the decrease in the absor-
bance of NADH at 340 nm using a microplate reader. The
standard assay mixture was composed of potassium phosphate
buﬀer (100 mM, pH 6.5), 0.5 mM NADH, 1 mM PPA, and the
appropriate diluted enzyme in a total volume of 200 ml. All
reactions were pre-mixed at 30 °C and initiated by adding
NADH. One unit of enzyme activity was dened as the amount
of enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 1 mmol of NADH per
minute.
Optimal temperature and thermostability analysis
The optimal reaction temperature of wild-type LrLDH and its
mutants was determined by measuring the enzyme activity of
each sample at temperatures ranging from 30 and 60 °C using
the standard assay conditions.
To assess the thermostability of wild-type LrLDH and its
mutants, the residual activity of the puried enzyme was
measured aer 30 min at 50 °C, with non-incubated enzyme as
the control. The half-lives (t1/2) were calculated according to the
rst-order deactivation function: ln(residual activity) = −kDt, t1/
2 = ln 2/kD, where kD represents the deactivation rate constant.30
For measuring the half inactivation temperature (T10
50) of
wild-type LrLDH and its mutants, dened as the temperature at
which enzymes lose 50% of the initial activity aer incubation
for 10 min, the puried enzymes were incubated at tempera-
tures ranging from 20 to 60 °C for 10 min, and the residual
activity was determined using the standard assay conditions
with non-incubated enzyme as the control.
Determination of kinetic parameters
The kinetic parameters of wild-type LrLDH and its mutants were
determined by measuring the enzyme activity at varying PPA
concentrations (1–5 mM) and a xed NADH concentration (0.5
mM). The data were tted to the Michaelis–Menten model using
the soware Origin 9.0.
Molecular dynamics simulations
The molecular dynamics simulations were performed with
Gromacs 2018, using “chain A” of wild-type LrLDH and its
variants. The force eld was selected with GROMOS 53a6. The
protein was solvated in water. spc216.gro was used as the
solvent conguration for simple point charge (SPC) water. To
balance the system, Na+ or Cl−ions were added to the simula-
tion box to replace the solvent. Then, the structure was relaxed
through energy minimization. Furthermore, the NVT equili-
bration was performed at 343 K for 100 ps and 1 bar in the NPT
equilibration for 100 ps. Finally, the MD simulations were
carried out for 100 ns. The root mean square deviation (RMSD)
and radius of gyration (Rg) of wild-type LrLDH and its variants
were calculated.31

Results and discussion
Identication of hotspot residues
Our previous study suggested that LrLDH from Lactobacillus
rossiae is a promising biocatalyst for the eﬃcient synthesis of D-
phenyllactic acid and other ne chemicals. However, the poor
thermostability (t1/2 at 50 °C of only 3.7 min) hampered its
practical application.20 To better meet the requirements of
industrial application, we attempted to improve the thermo-
stability of LrLDH. HotSpot Wizard is a popular tool for the
automated
prediction
of
hotspots
for
rational
enzyme
improvement based on structural, functional and evolutionary
information obtained from diﬀerent databases.28 Many vivid
examples have demonstrated its eﬀectiveness not only in
tailoring the catalytic activity, but also in improving the ther-
mostability of enzymes.32–35 To predict residues that might
aﬀect the enzyme's thermostability, a 3D homology models of
LrLDH was constructed (Fig. 1a) and uploaded to the HotSpot
Wizard web server. Aer calculating, 8 stability hot spots (Pro
239, Phe 306, Ser 301, Phe 274, Leu237, Asn 218, Asp 249, T247)
were shown in the website. The amino acid residues around the
catalytic site, including the residues in catalytic pocket and the
tunnels, may appreciable impact the catalytic activity of
enzyme.36 Excluding these residues, 5 amino acid residues
located far from the active center were selected (N218, L237,
T247, D249 and S301) and chosen as engineering targets for the
thermostability mutagenesis (Fig. 1b).
Construction and screening of mutant libraries
Subsequently, site-saturation mutagenesis was conducted by
PCR with the plasmid pET28a-lrldh as the template. The
generated mutant plasmids were introduced into E. coli for
expression. According to the gene sequence analysis, all 95
mutants covering each site were obtained, and a single site
mutant library was generated.
The strains harboring the wild-type lrldh or its mutants were
cultivated and induced with lactose. The protein-expressing cells
were disrupted and the enzymes were puried by Ni2+-chelating

aﬃnity chromatography. We subsequently performed thermo-
stability screening by incubated the puried enzymes at 50 °C for
5 min, followed by immediate cooling in an ice-bath and
measurement of the residual activity. An enzyme sample that was
not heated was included as a control. As shown in Table 2, 10
single mutants (S301M, S301R, T247I, T247C, T247W, D249A,
N218V, N218T, L237K and L237C) presented better thermosta-
bility than the wild-type LrLDH (with a residual activity of 37.7%).
The T247I variant was the best single mutant, and it retained
93.31% residual activity aer heat treatment. Almost all of the
mutants (including T247I) suﬀered a decline of specic activity
relative to wild-type LrLDH, as there is a general trade-oﬀbetween
catalytic activity and stability.30 To our surprise, the variant
D249A exhibited a simultaneous improvement of catalytic activity
and thermostability, with approximately 6-fold higher specic
activity (3.10 U mg−1) and nearly 60% higher residual activity
(62.03%) than the wild-type LrLDH. To combine the advantages,
double and triple mutants were also constructed. Aer screening,
the double-mutant variants T247I/N218V, D249A/T247W, and
L237K/T247C, as well as the triple-mutant variants D249A/T247I/
S301M, D249A/T247I/S301R, D249A/T247I/N218T, D249A/T247I/
L237K, and D249A/T247I/L237C displayed enhanced thermosta-
bility but a lower specic activity than the wild-type enzyme.
Conversely, the variants D249A/N218T and D249A/T247I/N218V
showed a better specic activity but a poor thermal stability.
However, we fortunately obtained the double-mutant variant
D249A/T247I with a specic activity of 1.61 U mg−1 and a residual
activity of 89.07%. In comparison with the wild-type enzyme, that
was an approximately 2-fold improvement of catalytic activity and
nearly 40% higher residual activity. Although the mutant D249A/
T247I sacriced a small amount of thermostability, the catalytic
activity was signicantly improved compared with the mutant
T247I (Table 2). This variant therefore strikes a good balance of
improved thermostability and catalytic activity. Additionally, The
SDS-PAGE results indicated that both the mutant D249A and
D249A/T247I exhibited better soluble expression in E. coli (Fig. 2),
which is consistent with their improved stability.

range of 20–60 °C (Fig. 3a).The thermal inactivation curves were
recorded by measuring the time-variance of residual enzyme
activity at 50 °C. As illustrated in Fig. 3b, wild-type LrLDH, as
well as mutant D249A and D249A/T247I, all suﬀered a rapid
decline of activity. The data were tted nonlinearly using the
soware Origin 9.0 to calculate the t1/2. As shown in Table 3, the
t1/2 values of wild-type LrLDH, D249A and D249A/T247I were
3.70, 7.88 and 21.66 min, respectively, while the T10
50 values were
38, 44 and 57 °C. This result indicated that the thermostability
of LrLDH was signicantly enhanced by this rational muta-
genesis strategy.
To investigate the optimal temperature of wild-type LrLDH
and the mutants, the catalytic activity towards PPA was deter-
mined at diﬀerent temperatures in the range of 30–60 °C. As
shown in Fig. 3c, an Asp to Ala substitution at position 249
resulted in a small increase of the optimum temperature from
40 °C (wild-type) to 44 °C. Aer combination with the T247I
mutation, the double-mutant variant D249A/T247I exhibited
a further increase of the optimal temperature to 52 °C.
Determination of kinetic parameters
The specic enzyme activity of wild-type LrLDH, the single
mutant D249A and the double mutant D249A/T247I at diﬀerent
substrate concentrations (1–5 mM PPA) was determined at
a xed NADH concentration. The data were subjected to
nonlinear tting to the Michaelis–Menten equation (Fig. 4). As
illustrated in Table 3, the maximum reaction velocities (Vmax) of
wild-type LrLDH, single mutant D249A and double mutant
D249A/T247I were 1.95, 8.01 and 5.28 U mg−1, respectively. The
corresponding Michaelis constants (Km) were 2.83, 1.67 and
2.32 mM. The mutation of aspartate 249 to alanine resulted in
a more than 3-fold improvement of Vmax and an approximately
41% decrease in Km. As a result, the D249A mutant exhibited
6.21-fold increase of catalytic eﬃciency (kcat/Km) toward PPA.
The addition of the T247I mutation resulted in a signicant
reduction in kcat/Km, but the value (1.47 s−1 mM−1) was still
much higher than that of wild-type LrLDH (0.43 s−1 mM−1).
Nakano et al.,37 obtained a double mutant D-LDH T75L/A234S by
site-directed mutagenesis. Using pyruvate as the substrate, the
mutation give a 6.8-fold improvement in kcat/Km, which was
better than our results. Nevertheless, we got robust enzymes
with both enhanced thermostability and higher specic activity,
which has a good application value in industry.
Molecular dynamics simulations
To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the enhanced
thermostability of the best variant, molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations were performed at 343 K (70 °C), in which root

mean square deviation (RMSD) and radius of loop (Rg) values
were recorded over 100 ns.
RMSD represents the mean deviation of position between the
protein structure and original conformation in 3D space at
a specic time, which is an important indicator for evaluating the
stability of enzymes. As shown in Fig. 5a, the RMSD value of wild-
type LrLDH at 343 K was gradually increased and greatly uctu-
ated, indicating that the structure of the enzyme was unstable
and could be easily inactivated at high temperature. By contrast,
the RMSD values of the single mutant D249A and double mutant
D249A/T247I were both basically stable at about 30 ns, and much
lower than that of wild-type LrLDH. These two mutant enzymes
therefore showed good structural stability at high temperature.
Furthermore, compared with the single mutant enzyme D249A,
the uctuation of RMSD value of the double mutant D249A/T247I
was smaller aer 60 ns, indicating that the thermostability was
further improved by combined mutation.
The Rg value reects the compactness of the enzyme struc-
ture. As shown in Fig. 5b, The Rg value of wild-type LrLDH
displayed an increasing trend over 100 ns, indicating that the
enzyme expanded at high temperature due to poor thermosta-
bility. The Rg value of mutant D249A gradually decreased and
stabilized at about 70 ns, indicating that the structure of the
enzyme tends to contract. The average value was about 2.15,
much lower than that of wild-type LrLDH, indicating better
thermostability.
In the double mutant D249A/T247I,

stabilization time of the Rg value shortened to 67 ns, and the
average value was reduced to about 2.15 (Fig. 5b). These results
indicated that the protein structure was packed tighter than in
wild-type LrLDH and the single mutant D249A, which slowed
down the enzyme's inactivation at high temperatures.
Consequently, the MD simulations suggested that both the
single mutant D249A and double mutant D249A/T247I had
increased thermostability, which may be due to the enhance-
ment of structural rigidity of the enzyme molecule caused by the
change of intramolecular forces in the peripheral structure.38
The calculated thermostability of mutant D249A/T247I was
better than that of mutant D249A, which was consistent with
the experimental results.
Elucidating the mechanism of the enhanced activity
To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the enhanced cata-
lytic activity of the best variant, structural models of wild-type
LrLDH, the single mutant D249A and the double mutant
D249A/T247I were constructed based on the crystal structure of
LDH from Lactobacillus helveticus (PDB ID: 2DLD). Subse-
quently, PPA and NADH were docked into the active site (Fig. 6).
When the substrate approached, the active center of the enzyme
underwent a conformational change and the substrate was
bound mainly through hydrophobic interactions, aer which
the catalytic reaction commenced. As it’s stated in the literature
of Wang et al.,39 the hydrophobic interactions between the
active center and the substrate, as well as the conformation of
the active center, especially in terms of steric hindrance, have
signicant inuence on the catalytic activity of the enzyme.
However, amino acid residues 247 and 249 are both far from the
active center of the enzyme (Fig. 6a), and mutations at these two
sites have no signicant eﬀect on steric hindrance or hydro-
phobicity at the active site. However, NADH is the hydride donor
in the redox reactions catalyzed by LDHs, whereby the hydrogen
on the fourth carbon atom of the nicotinamide ring is trans-
ferred to the carbonyl carbon of the substrate, whereby the
carbonyl is reduced to a hydroxyl.27 Therefore, a closer distance
between carbon 4 of the NADH nicotinamide ring and the
carbonyl carbon of the substrate leads to higher hydride
transfer eﬃciency, resulting in higher overall LDH catalytic
activity. As shown in Fig. 6b–d, in the structures of wild-type
LrLDH, single mutant D249A and double mutant D249A/
T247I, the distances between carbon 4 of the NADH nicotin-
amide ring and the carbonyl carbon were 3.4, 2.5 and 2.9 ˚A,
respectively. As a result, the catalytic activity of mutant D249A
toward PPA was much higher than that of D249A/T247I and
wild-type LrLDH. In addition, the Km values were in the order:
wild-type LrLDH > D249A/T247I > D249A, which can also help
explain the observed changes of catalytic activity.
Conclusions
In this study, the
D-LDH
LrLDH was engineered using
computationally-assisted
rational
mutagenesis.
The
two
mutants
D249A
and
D249A/T247I
showed
signicantly
enhanced thermostability and catalytic activity compared with
the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, the double mutant D249A/
T247I exhibited a favorable balance between the two catalytic
properties. MD simulations indicated that both D249A and
D249A/T247I enzyme molecules tend to contract at high
temperatures rather than expanding and unfolding, leading to
the enhancement of thermostability. According to the kinetic
analysis
and
molecular
docking,
the
mutants
exhibited
increased aﬃnity for PPA, with a shortened distance between
the C4 atom of the nicotinamide ring of NADH and the carbonyl
carbon atom of PPA, which also helps explain the observed
improvement of catalytic activity toward PPA.
