Abstract
Optimizing enzyme thermostability is essential for advancements in protein science and industrial applications. Currently,
(semi‐)rational design and random mutagenesis methods can accurately identify single‐point mutations that enhance enzyme
thermostability. However, complex epistatic interactions often arise when multiple mutation sites are combined, leading to the
complete inactivation of combinatorial mutants. As a result, constructing an optimized enzyme often requires repeated rounds
of design to incrementally incorporate single mutation sites, which is highly time‐consuming. In this study, we developed an AI‐
aided strategy for enzyme thermostability engineering that efﬁciently facilitates the recombination of beneﬁcial single‐point
mutations. We utilized thermostability data from creatinase, including 18 single‐point mutants, 22 double‐point mutants, 21
triple‐point mutants, and 12 quadruple‐point mutants. Using these data as inputs, we used a temperature‐guided protein
language model, Pro‐PRIME, to learn epistatic features and design combinatorial mutants. After two rounds of design, we
obtained 50 combinatorial mutants with superior thermostability, achieving a success rate of 100%. The best mutant, 13M4,
contained 13 mutation sites and maintained nearly full catalytic activity compared to the wild‐type. It showed a 10.19°C
increase in the melting temperature and an ~655‐fold increase in the half‐life at 58°C. Additionally, the model successfully
captured epistasis in high‐order combinatorial mutants, including sign epistasis (K351E) and synergistic epistasis (D17V/I149V).
We elucidated the mechanism of long‐range epistasis in detail using a dynamics cross‐correlation matrix method. Our work
provides an efﬁcient framework for designing enzyme thermostability and studying high‐order epistatic effects in protein‐
directed evolution.

Impact statement
In this study, we developed a novel strategy for combining multiple positive mutations using a deep learning‐based protein
language model. Our ﬁne‐tuned AI model effectively captured complex long‐range epistasis and accurately predicted the
optimal combination of multiple beneﬁcial mutations. By using this approach, we successfully combined 18 single‐point
mutants in just two rounds of design, achieving a 100% success rate. Traditionally, this would require 18 rounds of directed
evolution. Additionally, the dynamics cross‐correlation matrix analysis elucidated the mechanism of dynamically mediated
long‐range epistasis, enhancing our understanding of the impacts of mutations during the evolutionary process.
INTRODUCTION
Protein engineering to enhance enzyme thermostability is
crucial for expanding the applications of natural enzymes in
industrial settings1–3. Over the past 20 years, (semi‐)rational
design and random mutagenesis strategies have proven
effective in identifying single‐point mutants that improve
enzyme stability4–7. However, combining multiple mutation
sites to create optimized variants often introduces unwanted
epistasis in the vast combinatorial sequence space, which
can lead to the complete inactivation of the combinatorial
mutants8–10. Epistasis indicates that residues within a protein
interact with each other, so the effects of multiple mutations
are not simply the sum of the effects of individual single‐point

mutations11. This complexity means that combining multiple
mutations often requires numerous rounds of trial and error,
making the process highly time‐consuming. A recent ap-
proach, the stepwise combination method based on a
greedy strategy, also depends heavily on multiple rounds of
repetitive experiments12–14. This approach has the dis-
advantage of a signiﬁcant waiting time for the results of
previous rounds, severely limiting the efﬁciency of protein
engineering.
Complex epistasis between mutations, which refers to the
nonadditivity of the effects of two or more amino acids,
presents a major obstacle to accurately predicting the optimal
combination of mutations, particularly for high‐order combi-
natorial mutants involving three or more mutations15–19. Re-
search on both natural and laboratory protein evolution has
shown that epistasis is more common than previously rec-
ognized20. Notably, some functional mutations that are neutral
or detrimental in the wild‐type (WT) background may become
beneﬁcial at later stages of evolution, indicating that these
mutations are unpredictable from the starting point21. Cap-
turing the epistasis between mutations accurately remains a
challenge in efﬁciently exploring the combinatorial sequence
space18. Addressing this challenge could signiﬁcantly reduce
combinatorial complexity and improve the efﬁciency of en-
zyme engineering.
The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has
sparked a revolution in artiﬁcial intelligence. Recently, several
large‐scale protein language models (PLMs) have been in-
troduced, including the ESM model family22,23, ProtTrans24,
ProGen25, and xTrimoPGLM26. These models are trained on
extensive protein data sets containing tens of millions of se-
quences, allowing them to capture evolutionary patterns and
sequence features in vector space24,26,27. However, these
models are typically trained on a vast number of unlabeled se-
quences from databases like UniProt28 and Pfam29. As a result,
the learned representations primarily capture the general context
of broad protein families and do not provide detailed inter-
pretations of speciﬁc protein properties, such as thermostability
and enzyme activity. Consequently, most protein language
models have not fully leveraged experimentally measured data
with labels, leaving room for improvement in the accuracy and
efﬁciency of functional predictions30–32.
We developed Pro‐PRIME, protein language model for in-
telligent masked pretraining and environment (temperature)
prediction, based on a data set of optimal growth temperatures
(OGTs) from 96 million host bacterial strains33. Pro‐PRIME uses a
multi‐task learning paradigm to capture temperature‐related
features associated with sequences in the data set. This ap-
proach enables Pro‐PRIME to assign higher scores to se-
quences that show enhanced temperature tolerance and align
with natural biological principles. Consequently, Pro‐PRIME ex-
cels
in
designing
and
optimizing
enzymes
that
require
high‐temperature tolerance. Furthermore, by ﬁne‐tuning the
pre‐trained weights and incorporating a limited number of ex-
perimental results to adjust the parameters of the protein lan-
guage models, we can signiﬁcantly enhance predictive accuracy.
This is particularly effective for predicting high‐order epistasis,
which involves interactions between three or more mutations.
Therefore, we plan to integrate Pro‐PRIME with supervised
tuning, as this strategy could effectively address the challenge of
efﬁciently combining multiple mutations.
In this study, we selected creatinase, a hydrolase crucial
for diagnosing human kidney function34, to assess the
feasibility of our strategy for practical thermostability en-
gineering. In previous research, we aimed to enhance the
stability of creatinase from Alcaligenes faecalis by designing
and screening approximately 20 signiﬁcant single‐point
mutants
using
a
non‐biased
phylogenetic
consensus
method35. However, evaluation of the thermostability of
each mutant required individual puriﬁcation and character-
ization, consuming signiﬁcant time and resources. Despite
applying a stepwise combination strategy, we were only
able to obtain a limited number of low‐order combinatorial
mutants, including double‐, triple‐, and quadruple‐point
mutants. This approach explored only a small portion of
the entire combinatorial sequence space within the avail-
able time frame. In this study, we introduced a novel ap-
proach for enhancing enzyme thermostability by efﬁciently
recombining beneﬁcial single‐point mutants with the help of
a protein language model. We ﬁne‐tuned the Pro‐PRIME
model using thermostability data from multiple single‐point
mutants and some low‐order combinatorial mutants of
creatinase. This allowed us to accurately predict changes in
protein stability and identify optimal combinations of single‐
point mutants. Additionally, we used a dynamic correlation
matrix based on the three‐dimensional structure to conduct
a mechanistic analysis of the complex epistasis observed in
high‐order combinatorial mutants identiﬁed by the Pro‐
PRIME model. This provides a deeper understanding of how
mutations inﬂuence thermostability.
RESULTS
Efﬁcient combination of multiple mutations
guided by the ﬁne‐tuned model
In our previous study35, we developed an unbiased consensus
method to enhance the thermostability of creatinase. By ana-
lyzing the frequency of amino acid residues in the phylogenetic
tree, we identiﬁed numerous candidate residues and screened
them to obtain 18 single‐point mutants with increased half‐life
(t1/2). We then combined these positive mutations using a
stepwise combinatorial strategy, resulting in several mutants
with further improved thermostability. This approach yielded
22 double‐point mutants, 21 triple‐point mutants, and 12
quadruple‐point mutants. To enable consistent comparison of
their thermostability and catalytic activity, we measured the
melting temperature (Tm) values and relative activities of these
mutants, which were used as the initial data set for this work
(Table S1). Among the 18 single‐point mutants, four had lower
Tm values compared to the WT: G58D, N130S, I240K, and
K351E. In contrast, four mutants showed signiﬁcantly higher Tm
values than WT (ΔTm > 1°C): D17V, V174I, T199S, and T251C.
Most single‐point mutants were located on the surface of the
creatine kinase structure (Figure S1).

We aimed to develop a model that rapidly predicts changes in
protein stability by combining pre‐trained molecular environment
representations with supervised ﬁne‐tuning. This approach
would guide the design of combinatorial mutants with enhanced
thermostability. Figure 1 illustrates the overall strategy. First, we
ﬁne‐tuned the Pro‐PRIME model to create a regression model for
thermostability and a discriminant model for relative activity,
using the initial data set with Tm and relative activity as labeled
values, respectively. Next, we used the ﬁne‐tuned Pro‐PRIME
models to predict the thermostability and activity of all mutants
within the combinatorial sequence space.
In enzyme engineering, there is often a trade‐off between
activity and stability, meaning that optimizing both parame-
ters simultaneously or equally is challenging36. Given our
primary goal of enhancing the thermostability of creatinase,
we aimed to avoid missing mutants that might slightly reduce
activity but signiﬁcantly improve stability. Therefore, we
considered mutants with more than 60% relative activity
compared to the WT as acceptable. Finally, we characterized
the selected mutants to obtain experimental data and pro-
vided these data as feedback to further ﬁne‐tune the model.
The Pro‐PRIME model, developed from previous research,
was trained on a data set containing the OGT of 96 million
sequence host bacterial strains. It demonstrated superior
predictive performance compared to other state‐of‐the‐art
models when validated across multiple data sets and in-
stances.
Using the ﬁne‐tuned Pro‐PRIME model, we predicted the
stability and activity distribution of all combinatorial mutants
derived from the 18 single‐point mutants (218 = 262,144). As
the initial data set included a maximum of quadruple‐point
mutants, we extended the validation to mutations involving
5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 points to assess the model's ability to predict
the performance of high‐order combinatorial mutants based
on low‐order mutation data. Our primary criterion for screening
was the ranking of predicted thermostability scores. As a re-
sult, we selected a total of 25 mutants (Table S2), representing
the top performers among variants with 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9
mutations.
The results from the ﬁrst round of predictions using the
ﬁne‐tuned model demonstrated excellent performance. We
successfully improved the thermostability of all 25 mutants
designed in this round compared to the WT, with increases
ranging from 7°C to 9.33°C. Furthermore, the activity level
of most mutants remained above 80% of that of the WT
enzyme (Figure 2). Notably, the Tm values of these 25 mu-
tants surpassed those of all mutants in the initial data set,
indicating a 100% success rate for the model in designing
stable mutants.
To enhance the prediction accuracy further, we integrated
the characterization results into the data set and conducted a
second round of ﬁne‐tuning, prediction, and selection (Fig-
ures 1 and 2). In the second round, we selected the top 25
ranked mutants based on their thermostability prediction
scores within the combinatorial sequence space. These mu-
tants contained 12–15 mutations (Table S3).
Compared to the WT, the thermostability of the 25 mu-
tants predicted in the second round was further improved,
with increases ranging from 8.17°C to 10.19°C, and overall
activity was maintained above 60% (Figure 2). The best‐
performing mutant in this round, 13M4, had 13 mutations and
showed a Tm increase of 10.19°C, with activity comparable to
the WT (Figure 3A and Table S3). This round showed minimal
differences between mutants, with a slight overall decrease
in activity. Therefore, we decided not to pursue further
iterations of the predictive model.

thermostability data for some mutants in the initial data set. Cyan and orange bars show thermostability data for all mutants in the ﬁrst‐ and
second‐round prediction, respectively. Relative activity is quantiﬁed by comparing the activity of the mutants to that of the wild‐type by using a
coupled enzymatic assay system. Thermostability is quantiﬁed using the differential scanning ﬂuorimetry (DSF) method, which allows for
high‐throughput measurement of the Tm of mutants.

The Tm values for both wild‐type (WT) and 13M4 were quantiﬁed by DSF (A), CD spectra (B), and DSC (C). In addition, ΔH could be calculated
from the results of DSC (C). The dashed lines correspond to the Tm of creatinase. Kinetic stability parameters include T50

derived from the results of the thermal inactivation curves of WT and 13M4 (D), as indicated by the dashed lines. The t1/2 was calculated from
the thermal inactivation curve of WT (E) and 13M4 (F) under heat treatment at 58°C. CD, circular dichroism; DSC, differential scanning

Thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the
best‐stabilized variant
To further validate the enhanced thermostability of the composite
mutants identiﬁed during the screening process, we conducted a
comprehensive characterization of the thermodynamic and ki-
netic stability of the most favorable mutant, 13M4, in comparison
to the WT, as shown in Figure 3. The Tm of proteins is the tem-
perature at which 50% of the protein molecules unfold. It reﬂects
the changes in protein conformation with temperature and serves
as a key indicator of thermodynamic stability. We used three
commonly used methods to determine protein Tm values: DSF,
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and circular dichroism
(CD) spectroscopy. Each technique measures different aspects
of protein behavior during heating. DSF detects the exposure of
hydrophobic groups within proteins as they unfold with heating.
DSC assesses thermodynamic parameters by measuring the
difference in power required to maintain the sample and refer-
ence at the same temperature. CD spectroscopy evaluates
changes in the secondary structure of proteins throughout the
heating process37.

The outcomes from the different methods were consistent, as
shown in Figure 3A–C. Compared to the WT, the 13M4 mutant
showed a signiﬁcantly higher Tm, with an approximate increase
of 10°C (ranging from 9.24°C to 10.19°C). We also used the DSC
method to measure the enthalpy change (ΔH), which quantiﬁes
the energy required for the protein unfolding reaction38. The ΔH
of 13M4 was approximately 200 kJ/mol higher than that of WT,
indicating stronger internal attractive forces in 13M4. These re-
sults highlight the signiﬁcant enhancement in the thermodynamic
stability of 13M4.
For kinetic stability, we assessed the semi‐inactivation
temperature (T50
15) and half‐life (t1/2) of both WT and 13M4.
WT became completely inactive after 15 min of incubation at
60°C, while 13M4 retained 93.5% of its activity under the
same conditions. Additionally, 13M4 showed a notable in-
crease in T50
15, being 10°C higher than that of WT (Figure 3D).
At 58°C, the t1/2 of WT was only 1.6 min (Figure 3E), whereas
13M4's t1/2 extended to 1049.45 min (Figure 3F), representing
a remarkable 655.91‐fold enhancement.
In terms of catalytic efﬁciency, 13M4 maintained a level of
activity (98%) comparable to that of the WT. Catalytic kinetic
results showed that the kcat values of 13M4 and WT were similar.
However, the Km value for 13M4, which indicates substrate af-
ﬁnity, was slightly improved (Figure S2). Detailed data on stability
and kinetic parameters are provided in Table 1. These results
demonstrate that 13M4 is signiﬁcantly more thermally stable
than WT and holds promising potential for industrial applications.
Molecular mechanisms underlying higher
thermostability of 13M4
After thoroughly characterizing the optimal mutant and the WT,
we aimed to investigate the molecular basis for the observed
improvements in thermostability through structural analysis and
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We used the WT structure
obtained from our previous study, where we elucidated the
crystal structure of WT using X‐ray crystallography (PDB
7YTO)39. We modeled the structure of mutant 13M4 based on
the WT crystal structure coordinates and used MD simulations to
equilibrate and reﬁne the in silico mutant model (Figure S3 shows
the structural comparison before and after mutation in 13M4).
We conducted 100 ns MD simulations of both WT and 13M4 at
62°C. The detailed simulation protocol is provided in the Mate-
rials and Methods section.
Analyses
of
root
mean
square
ﬂuctuation
(RMSF),
number of random coils, solvent‐accessible surface area
(SASA), and radius of gyration (Rg) revealed signiﬁcant ri-
gidiﬁcation and compaction of the 13M4 mutant (Figure 4).
Speciﬁcally, the RMSF of 13M4 was lower than that of the
WT, indicating that the atoms or residues in 13M4 experi-
enced less displacement during the simulation and were
more stable compared to WT (Figure 4A). The average
number of random coils was also lower in 13M4 than in WT,
likely because the mutations in 13M4 reduced the number
of
unstructured
regions,
decreasing
ﬂexibility
and
in-
creasing rigidity between molecules (Figure 4B). Addition-
ally, the average SASA of 13M4 was lower than that of WT,
suggesting that a greater proportion of 13M4's surface was
covered by atoms within the molecule, leading to a reduced
contact area with the solvent (Figure 4C). SASA is a crucial
factor in protein folding and stability studies. Generally, in
protein engineering, lower SASA values indicate a more
compact and stable structure for mutant enzymes40,41. The
lower SASA observed in mutant 13M4 compared to the WT
indicated a tighter packing of its structure. This tighter
packing made 13M4 less prone to unfolding at high tem-
peratures and reduced the impact of solvent molecules on
its internal structure, thereby enhancing overall enzyme
stability. The Rg of 13M4 was also lower than that of WT,
suggesting that 13M4 is smaller and more compact. Rg
measures the compactness of a molecule's overall shape,
and smaller Rg values typically indicate a more compact
structure (Figure 4D). These quantitative results suggest
that the mutations in 13M4 have increased the rigidity of the
enzyme by reducing local dynamics and unfolding motions
while compressing the tertiary structure to limit exposure.
This ﬁnding is consistent with the observed increase in ΔH.
Thus, the combined effects of reduced ﬂexibility and en-
hanced compactness likely contribute signiﬁcantly to the
enzyme's resistance to thermal denaturation, providing
substantial thermal stabilization.
We further explored the molecular basis of the enhanced
thermostability by analyzing the modeled structure of mu-
tant 13M4. Figures 5 and S4 show the structural compar-
ison between the WT and 13M4 in the vicinity of the
mutations. We examined changes in inter‐residue inter-
actions around the mutation sites. The single‐point mutation
(L6P) introduced a proline substitution in a ﬂexible region,
reducing the conformational entropy of the locally unfolded
protein and resulting in a more rigid spatial structure
(Figure 5A). Similar patterns of increased rigidity have been
observed in other modiﬁed enzyme molecules4,42. Speciﬁ-
cally, the D17V mutation introduced three additional van der
Waals interactions (Figure 5B). The F108Y/Y109F/R113Q
mutation
caused
a
signiﬁcant
rearrangement
of
the
hydrogen‐bonding network, with the R113Q variant adding
one hydrogen bond (Figure 5C). The hydrogen‐bonding
network was also rearranged around several other muta-
tions, including I149V (Figure S4A), V174I/T199S/I204V
(Figure 5D), and K351E (Figure S4C). Notably, the V174I/
T199S/I204V mutation introduced an additional salt bridge,

while the Q165I mutation resulted in a reduced hydrogen
bond (Figure S4B). No direct interaction changes were
observed
around
the
T251C
and
E349V
mutations
(Figure S4C).
These ﬁndings indicate that multiple mutations sig-
niﬁcantly impact the interaction network throughout the
protein, collectively enhancing stability. MD simulations
quantiﬁed the changes in interaction forces before and after
the mutations. The results showed that the number of
hydrogen bonds in 13M4 decreased compared to WT
(Figure 5E), while the number of salt bridges remained largely
unchanged (Figure 5F). Conversely, van der Waals potential
energy was decreased in 13M4 (Figure 5G).
Epistatic effects of mutations captured by the
ﬁne‐tuned Pro‐PRIME model
The functional impact of an amino acid mutation often depends
on the background sequence into which it is introduced. This
dependence on the genetic background, known as epis-
tasis43,44, can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence protein evolution. A muta-
tion that is beneﬁcial in one context may be deleterious or
neutral in another21. Epistasis can occur either through direct
interactions between amino acids or through distal, indirect
interactions, with the potential for exponential increases in
epistatic effects as the number of mutations increases44. Al-
though capturing nonlinear and long‐range epistatic effects is
challenging, our results indicate that the ﬁne‐tuned Pro‐PRIME
model successfully captures various epistatic interactions. For
example, the K351E mutation demonstrated divergent effects
depending on the mutational background, a phenomenon
known as sign epistasis19. This mutation showed both positive
and negative inﬂuences, as illustrated in Figure 6A. Another
notable case involves the single‐point mutations D17V and
I149V. These mutations displayed synergistic epistasis19, as
shown in Figure 6B. The combination of D17V and I149V cre-
ated a local optimum for protein thermostability. Introducing
one or two additional beneﬁcial mutations in this context re-
duced the Tm value, indicating that D17V/I149V established a
stable intermediate. However, the introduction of three or more
mutations, such as L6P/V174I/T199S, overcame this evolu-
tionary barrier and further increased the Tm value (Figure 6B).
It is noteworthy that after two rounds of reﬁnement, the Pro‐
PRIME model effectively captured the epistatic effects present
in the data set, which facilitated predictions of optimal combi-
nations. The frequency of the K351E mutation increased sig-
niﬁcantly throughout the evolution process, with ratios of
4/73, 3/25, and 24/25 in the initial data set, and the ﬁrst and
second rounds of prediction results, respectively (Tables S1‐
S3). This indicates that effective epistasis identiﬁed in low‐order
mutants was consistently captured by the large protein lan-
guage model, as evidenced by the increased likelihood of this
mutation appearing through the ﬁne‐tuning process. Similarly,
the frequency of the D17V/I149V mutation increased steadily
across the three data sets, reaching 14/73, 10/25, and 25/25,
respectively (Tables S1‐S3). In contrast, the K351E mutation,
which showed negative effects in the WT background during
the stepwise combinatorial strategy, was either discarded or
not prioritized in subsequent predictions.
These mutations displayed signiﬁcant spatial separation
(>25 Å) (Figure S5), making it difﬁcult to analyze the epistatic
mechanisms through local static structures. To explore the
long‐range epistatic effects between mutations, we com-
puted dynamics cross‐correlation matrices (DCCMs) for the
WT and selected mutant variants. DCCMs illustrate the cor-
relation coefﬁcient (Cij) between speciﬁc atoms of each
amino acid within a protein, such as Cα atoms, providing
insights
into
the
correlated
motions
of
the
protein45.
Cij values range from 0 to 1, indicating positive correlations,
and from −1 to 0, indicating negative correlations. Positive
correlations reﬂect simultaneous increases or decreases in
local kinetics across both regions, while negative correlations
indicate opposing changes.
Our analyses revealed that mutations altered the negative
correlations among regions of interest, particularly those
adjacent to the mutation sites. These regions are highlighted
by red boxes in Figure 6C. These dynamics‐related changes
mediated the observed long‐range epistasis. For example,
the introduction of the K351E mutation into the WT back-
ground diminished the negative correlation between the re-
gion near position 351 and the regions 1–90 amino acids (or
100–175 amino acids) (Figure 6C). This observation indicated
that the K351E mutation increased the RMSF in its vicinity
while also elevating RMSF in the regions 1–90 amino acids
(or 100–175 amino acids) (Figure 6D).
Increased RMSF indicated greater instability in these re-
gions, which explains the negative impact of the K351E single
mutation on the Tm values of the WT (Figure 6A). However,
when combined with higher‐order mutants (5‐M1, L6P/D17V/
F108Y/V174I/T199S), the K351E mutation signiﬁcantly en-
hanced
the negative
correlation
between
these
regions
(Figure 6C). This indicated that, in this context, the K351E
mutation actually improved the local stability of regions 1–90
amino acids (or 100–175 amino acids) (ΔRMSF ≤0) (Figure 6D),
thereby positively affecting the overall protein Tm value
(Figure 6A).
Similarly, changes in dynamic correlations between
D17V/I149V and other mutations aligned with the observed
epistasis on Tm values when they were combined. For in-
stance, in the triple‐point mutant D17V/I149V/V174I, we
observed a reduced negative correlation between D17V/
I149V and regions 1 (220–237 aa) and 2 (363–373 aa)
(Figure 6C). Concurrently, D17V and I149V decreased their
local stability (ΔRMSF > 0), which led to a reduction in the
local stability of regions 1 and 2 (Figure 6D) and con-
sequently a decrease in the mutant's Tm (Figure 6B). In the
quintuple‐point mutant L6P/D17V/I149V/V174I/T199S, the
negative correlation between D17V/I149V and regions 1 and
2 increased (Figure 6C). Although D17V and I149V were
unfavorable for their own local stability, they improved the
local stability of regions 1 and 2 (ΔRMSF ≤0) (Figure 6D),
which explains the observed increase in Tm with the addi-
tion of D17V/I149V. These results demonstrate that muta-
tions can affect not only their own local stability but also
498

potentially inﬂuence the stability of other regions through
interactions, resulting in non‐additive effects on stability
known as epistasis. Such inter‐mutational interactions at the
dynamic level can be partially detected and analyzed
through dynamic correlation matrices.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we successfully integrated deep learning with
protein engineering to efﬁciently combine single‐point mu-
tations. We used the Pro‐PRIME model, which we ﬁne‐tuned
based on a comprehensive data set of 99 experimental data

points (74 mutations from the initial data set and 25 muta-
tions from the ﬁrst round of prediction). This approach al-
lowed us to rapidly explore over 260,000 possible mutations
(218) within the combinatorial library. All 50 mutants that
entered the experimental screening phase demonstrated
improved thermostability, achieving a 100% success rate.
We accurately combined 13 mutations in only two rounds of
experiments. The best mutant, 13M4, showed a signiﬁcant
increase of 10.19°C in apparent melting temperature com-
pared to the WT, indicating exceptional long‐term stability.
Furthermore, 13M4 showed a 655.91‐fold improvement in
the half‐life at 58°C while maintaining catalytic activity com-
parable to that of the WT. This makes 13M4 a promising
candidate for creatinine detection applications. These results
highlight the effectiveness of our customized design strategy
in enhancing thermostability and provide a novel framework
for improving the thermostability of other commercially im-
portant enzymes.
In the vast protein sequence space, the number of possible
mutants is enormous, while functional proteins are relatively
rare9. In recent years, researchers have developed various
focused mutagenesis methods that require minimal screening.
These methods include the combinatorial active‐site satu-
ration test (CAST), iterative saturation mutagenesis (ISM), and
rational enzyme design approaches such as focused rational
iterative site‐speciﬁc mutagenesis (FRISM). These techniques
enhance the efﬁciency of identifying positive mutants for at-
tributes such as selectivity, activity, and thermostability46,47.
Despite these advances, effectively combining multiple pos-
itive mutants remains challenging. Traditional directed re-
combination or random mutation strategies typically require a
large number of experiments48–50. Recently, the greedy
strategy has become a common approach for combining
multiple mutations. This strategy involves constructing and
screening high‐order combinatorial mutants gradually by
combining advantageous single‐point mutations based on
existing best‐performing variants. However, when mutations
interact epistatically, this combinatorial process may not easily
identify effective evolutionary pathways. To address this issue,
researchers have proposed improved greedy strategies14,51.
These strategies categorize mutations into different classes
based on calculated parameters and then combine them
stepwise to explore as many possibilities as possible. How-
ever, this approach still faces time constraints due to multiple
rounds of combination. For example, Wu's group obtained the
best mutant after 13 rounds of combination, a process that
could take 13 to 39 weeks under conventional experimental
conditions14.
In our study, we demonstrate that ﬁne‐tuning protein lan-
guage models with experimental data offer a more efﬁcient
solution for exploring protein sequence space. This approach
allows us to rapidly explore all possible combinations, effec-
tively avoiding local optima caused by epistatic effects while
minimizing the workload and time required for screening. By
performing only two rounds of design and validation with 50
mutants, we quickly identiﬁed multiple high‐order combina-
torial mutants with improved thermostability, pinpointing the
optimal combination of 13 sites. Each learning and prediction
round required only 1 week, with most of the time spent
waiting for computations to complete. Notably, the number of
combinatorial
mutants
increased
exponentially
with
the
number of single‐point mutations. Thus, selecting single‐point
mutations carefully is crucial, as the number of these muta-
tions determines the computational resources needed to
predict all combinatorial mutants. With adequate computa-
tional resources, it is possible to include a few valuable neg-
ative mutations in the single‐point mutation library, such as
those that reduce thermostability but increase activity. These
negative mutations might yield surprising results in the ﬁnal
combination.
Interestingly, upon reviewing the experimental data, we
observed complex high‐order epistatic effects among certain
mutations, even when these mutations were spatially distant.
Epistasis disrupts smooth, additive, and predictable muta-
tional behavior, altering gradients in the ﬁtness landscape.
This alteration can make the path to a global optimum
lengthy or introduce local optima, where traditional directed
evolution methods may become trapped52. Currently avail-
able mutation data sets often describe epistasis at only a few
positions, typically single‐ and double‐point mutants. This
limitation makes it challenging to detect complex epistasis in
high‐order combinatorial mutants in protein evolution and
engineering studies. In contrast, our strategy efﬁciently
captures and predicts epistasis from both trained sequence
data and data used for ﬁne‐tuning. The ﬁne‐tuned model
accurately applied these long‐range interactions between
mutations to predict combinatorial mutants. Results from
dynamic correlation matrix analysis showed that mutations
affecting stability inﬂuence not only the dynamics of their
local environment but also, in some cases, impact the dy-
namics of distant structural regions53–55. This mechanism
mediates long‐range epistasis, suggesting that future protein
engineering strategies could utilize changes in correlated
dynamic networks for a deeper analysis of epistasis. This
insight prompted us to integrate structural data into protein
language models, potentially providing these models with
more detailed information about interactions between amino
acid residues. Several models have already combined un-
annotated sequence data with structural data to train protein
language models, achieving good predictive accuracy56,57.
Moreover,
computing
DCCMs
of
mutations
and
in-
corporating them into machine learning models present an in-
triguing application. This approach could provide unique data
on epistatic effects. Compared to wet experiments, data from
MD simulations are more time‐efﬁcient and cost‐effective,
thereby enhancing the efﬁciency of protein engineering. In
fact, combining MD simulation data with machine learning to
construct models has been successfully implemented in var-
ious ﬁelds, including protein sequence design58, protein con-
formational
ensemble
generation59, and enzyme function
prediction60.
In conclusion, we present a framework for enhancing
protein engineering efﬁciency by ﬁne‐tuning a general
temperature‐guided language model with a small amount of
500

experimental data. This approach allows us to construct
a
model
capable
of
accurately
identifying
sequence–
thermostability relationships and complex epistasis, thereby
guiding the efﬁcient combination of multiple signiﬁcant
single mutations. This framework could be readily applied to
other important enzymes. Additionally, the kinetic analysis
of complex epistasis offers a unique perspective for future
mechanistic studies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
The creatinase gene (BAA88830.1) was derived from Alcali-
genes faecalis. In this study, we used the I304L/F395V cre-
atinase variant (afCR‐M0)35 as the parent template to
construct additional variants, which we refer to as WT. We
cloned the creatinase gene into the pET‐28a(+) vector. We
then transferred the recombinant plasmid into E. coli DH5α
and E. coli BL21(DE3) for molecular cloning and protein ex-
pression, respectively. We purchased PrimerSTAR, DpnI,
and other reagents for the molecular cloning experiments
from TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd. We acquired Oxoid™
Tryptone and Oxoid™Yeast Extract Powder from Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc. Sodium chloride and nickel sulfate were
purchased from Shanghai Titan Scientiﬁc Co., Ltd. and
Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., respectively. Agar,
tris,
imidazole,
ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid
(EDTA),
phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) powder, kanamycin, and
isopropyl‐β‐D‐thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) were products of
Sangon Biotech. We obtained SYPRO® Orange Protein Gel
Stain from Sigma Aldrich. All other chemicals were of
analytical‐grade purity.
Protein expression and puriﬁcation
We initially grew the recombinant expression strain in 3 ml of
2×YT medium containing kanamycin (100 μg/ml) overnight at
37°C with orbital shaking at 220 rpm. We then used the
starter culture to inoculate 250 ml of 2×YT medium supple-
mented with kanamycin (100 μg/ml) in a shake ﬂask. We in-
cubated this ﬂask under the same conditions until the OD600
of the culture reached between 0.6 and 0.8. We induced
protein expression by adding IPTG to a ﬁnal concentration of
421 μM and continued incubating the culture at 20°C with
agitation at 220 rpm for 16–18 h. We harvested the cells by
centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C, washed them,
and resuspended them in binding buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl,
200 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). We disrupted the
cells using a high‐pressure homogenizer and centrifuged
the resulting lysate at 12,000g for 60 min to remove cellular
debris. We applied the clariﬁed supernatant to a pre‐
equilibrated Ni‐NTA column and eluted the bound proteins
using an imidazole gradient (20–200 mM). We evaluated the
purity of the eluted fractions by SDS‐PAGE. We pooled the
fractions containing the desired proteins, desalted them by
ultraﬁltration, concentrated them, and stored them at −80°C
in 1× PBS buffer (10 mmol/l phosphate buffer, 137 mmol/l
NaCl, 2.7 mmol/l KCl, pH 7.4).
Activity assay
We evaluated the catalytic activity of creatinase using a
coupled enzymatic assay system that included sarcosine
oxidase and horseradish peroxidase. We diluted the crea-
tinase sample to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mg/ml in 1× PBS
buffer. We measured enzyme activity by combining 50 μl of
the diluted enzyme with 950 μl of a reaction mixture con-
taining 0.5 mM creatine, 0.45 mM 4‐aminoantipyrine (4‐AA),
0.5 mM
N‐ethyl‐N‐(2‐hydroxy‐3‐sulfopropyl)−3‐methylaniline
(TOOS), and 1× PBS buffer. We conducted the assay at
37°C and monitored the rate of change in absorbance at
555 nm using a UV2550 spectrophotometer. We deﬁned one
unit of enzymatic activity as the amount of enzyme required
to produce 1 μM of hydrogen peroxide per minute under the
described assay conditions.
Thermodynamic stability analysis
DSF detects changes in the tertiary structure of proteins by
measuring the exposure of hydrophobic groups. We per-
formed this method by mixing protein samples with 5×
SYPRO Orange stain at a ﬁnal concentration of 6 μM and
placing them in octuplex PCR tubes. We standardized the
volume of each sample to 20 μl and conducted three sepa-
rate tests for each sample. We determined denaturation
curves using appropriate ﬁlter pairs (FAM470nm for ex-
citation and ROX625nm for emission) in a PCR instrument
(Analytik Jena qTower3). We increased the temperature from
25°C to 95°C in 0.5°C increments, holding each temperature
step for 5 s to allow equilibrium. We approximated the
melting temperature of the thermal expansion curve by
ﬁtting the Boltzmann equation61,62. We selected this method
to determine the Tm values of the mutants listed in Ta-
bles S1–S3 for its high‐throughput advantage.
We performed nano differential scanning calorimetry
(nanoDSC) analyses using nanoDSC equipment from TA In-
struments. We prepared the samples by diluting them to a
concentration of 1 mg/ml with 1× PBS buffer solution and
then loaded them into high‐sensitivity capillaries for de-
tection. During the experiment, we heated the proteins
through a controlled thermal ramp, increasing the temper-
ature from 20°C to 95°C at a constant rate of 1°C per minute
to induce and monitor the unfolding transition. We subjected
the protein unfolding process to this thermal ramp (20–95°C,
1°C/min). We analyzed the results, including Tm and ΔH,
using Launch NanoAnalyze software with the TwoSta-
teScaled model to ﬁt the experimental data.
We used CD to detect thermal inactivation processes in
proteins by measuring the decrease in polarized light
absorption as the secondary structure is disrupted. We
performed heat‐up experiments with a Jasco J‐1500 spec-
trometer using a 1 mm optical path cuvette. We monitored
the far‐UV CD signal (216 nm) as the temperature increased
from 25°C to 80°C at a heating rate of 1°C/min, recording
data
at
2°C
intervals.

spectively, during the thermal inactivation process of the
proteins.
Kinetic stability analysis
To determine the kinetic stability of the enzyme, we diluted
the puriﬁed enzyme to 1.0 mg/ml in 1× PBS buffer. We as-
sessed the t1/2 of the enzyme by incubating it at 62°C for
various time periods. We then measured the residual enzyme
activity at 37°C using the previously described methodology.
We calculated the enzyme's t1/2, which represents the time
required for the enzyme's initial activity to decrease by half,
using the ﬁrst‐order deactivation function: t1/2 = −ln (2)/k,
k * t = ln (Ar/A0), where k is the observed ﬁrst‐order deacti-
vation rate constant. Ar and A0 represent the residual activity
and initial activity of the enzyme, respectively.
We determined the T50
15 value by incubating the puriﬁed
enzyme at temperatures ranging from 25°C to 70°C for
15 min. After incubation, we allowed the sample to cool in an
ice bath. We then quantiﬁed the residual enzymatic activity
using the previously outlined methodology. The T50
15 value
indicates the temperature at which the enzyme activity is
reduced to 50% after 15 min of heat treatment, with the
highest activity considered to be 100%. We analyzed the
data by calculating the inﬂection point of the residual activity
ﬁtted to an S‐shaped plot using the Boltzmann function in
Origin software at a speciﬁc temperature.
Kinetic parameters
We measured the kinetic parameters (Km and kcat) in 1× PBS
buffer using various concentrations of the substrate creatine
(0.5, 2, 5, 8, 10, 14, 18, 30, 50, 80, and 120 mM). We
conducted
the
reactions
as
previously
described.
We
determined the reaction kinetics parameters by applying
the Michaelis–Menten model to the obtained data.
Fine‐tuning of the Pro‐PRIME
For the training process, we converted each mutant se-
quence, labeled appropriately, into a latent space repre-
sentation (L × 1280) using Pro‐PRIME's transformer‐encoder,
where L represents the protein length. We averaged the
1280‐dimensional amino acid vectors to create a repre-
sentative vector for each sequence. This representative
vector served as input for a regression head layer that in-
cluded an MLP layer, a dropout layer, and a Tanh activation
function, yielding a single prediction score for each mutant.
We used the Adam optimizer and MSE as our loss function
with a maximum of 200 training epochs. We applied early
termination if MSE did not improve over 10 epochs. All
training was performed on a single 80GB NVIDIA A100 GPU
card, with a learning rate of 1e−5 and a batch size of 4.
Molecular dynamics simulations
We used the X‐ray crystal structure of WT creatinase from
previous work (PDB 7YTO)39 as the starting structure for the
MD simulation. For the 13M4 mutant, we used the same
structure as WT but incorporated 13 residue mutations as
described in the experiment. Our simulation box contained a
single creatinase molecule, with a minimum distance of 1 nm
between the protein and the box boundary. We added water
molecules to the box and supplemented it with 0.1 mol/l NaCl
to ensure charge neutrality. We simulated the protein using
the CHARMM27 force ﬁeld and the water using the TIP3P
model. We conducted the simulations using GROMACS‐
2021. We truncated the van der Waals interactions at 1.2 nm
using the Lennard–Jones potential, which was gradually
switched to zero at 1.0 nm. We calculated electrostatic in-
teractions using Particle Mesh Ewald with a Coulomb cutoff
of 1.2 nm. We speciﬁcally restrained hydrogen‐containing
bonds using the LINCS method, which allowed for a simu-
lation time step of 2 fs. We initially minimized the system's
energy using the steepest descent techniques, with a
threshold force of 10.0 kJ per mole per nanometer and up to
50,000 iterations.
We ﬁrst equilibrated the system at a constant volume and
temperature (NVT ensemble) at 335.15 K for 50 ns. We then
continued equilibration at constant pressure and temperature
(NPT ensemble) at 1 bar for an additional 50 ns. We regulated
the temperature using the velocity‐rescale algorithm with a
coupling period of 0.1 ps. We controlled the pressure using the
Parrinello–Rahman method with a coupling constant of 3 ps.
Next, we performed the production phase of the MD simulation
under NPT conditions for 200 ns, maintaining a time step of
2 fs. For analysis, we used the ﬁnal 100 ns of the simulation
trajectories, recorded at 100‐ps intervals. We visualized the
protein structures using the PyMOL package.
Dynamics cross‐correlation matrix
We calculated the DCCMs according to the guidelines63. We
determined the mutant's structure by modifying the corre-
sponding amino acid in the WT crystal structure. We com-
puted the DCCMs using Bio3D64, calculating the correlation
coefﬁcients for the Cα atoms. We archived the ﬁnal 10 ns of
the MD simulation trajectory at 10‐ps intervals and converted
the data into the dcd ﬁle format using the CatDCD extension
in VMD software65. We then input the resulting trajectory into
Bio3D. We derived the correlation matrices from averaging
across three independent simulation trajectories and graph-
ically represented them using the Origin software package.
