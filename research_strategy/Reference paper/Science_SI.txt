MATERIALS AND METHODS
Section S1. Protein Analysis
S1.1 Analysis of protein surface using PyMOL 1.5.0.3
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP), glucose oxidase (GOx), green fluorescent protein (GFP), and α-
chymotrypsin (α-CT) crystal structures – 1H55, 1CF3, 2HRW, and 1YPH respectively – were
obtained from the Protein Data Bank. PyMOL was used to simplify protein surfaces as non-
charged hydrophilic, hydrophobic, cationic, or anionic patches. Patches were approximated, to
the best of our abilities, as circles with distinct diameters, and distances between chemically-like
patches were measured using straight lines, from the center of one patch to the center of a
neighboring patch. Measurements were binned to the closest whole number, and frequencies
were normalized by the frequency of the mode. The histograms of diameter and distance of
charged patches are plotted in Fig. S1.
S1.2 Analysis of protein sequence based on binary hydrophobicity
       The program reads in an amino acid sequence from a protein database (PDB) file, and
assigns each amino acid a value of 0 or 1. All amino acids more hydrophilic than glycine are
assigned a value of 0, while all amino acids more hydrophobic than glycine including glycine are
assigned a value of 1. The scale is a binary adaptation of the scale established by Monera et al.
(11). Then, starting from the beginning of the chain, it counts the distance between two
hydrophilic residues to determine the size of that hydrophobic block. This is repeated until the
whole chain has been analyzed. The example histogram of block size distribution of horseradish
peroxide (HRP) is shown in Fig. S2.


Section S2. RHP Synthesis and Characterization
S2.1. Synthesis of RHP by RAFT polymerization
       Methyl methacrylate (1, 99%, Aldrich), ethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate (2,
99%, Mn = 500 g/mol, Aldrich), and 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate (3, 98%, Aldrich) were passed
through a short column of neutral alumina to remove inhibitor before use. 3-Sulfopropyl
methacrylate potassium salt (4, 98%, Aldrich) and solvents with the purest grades (Aldrich) were
used as received. S-methoxycarbonylphenylmethyl dithiobenzoate (5) RAFT chain transfer agent
was synthesized as described previously (32).
        A solution of 1 (513 mg, 5.13 mmol), 2 (1280 mg, 2.56 mmol), 3 (403 mg, 2.03 mmol), 4
(123 mg, 0.50 mmol), and 5 (11 mg, 0.04 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (3.2 mL) was
degassed by three freeze-pump-thaw cycles before being sealed off under vacuum. The reaction
scheme can be found in Fig. S3. After 20 h at 60 °C, the polymerization media was diluted in
dichloromethane, precipitated in diethyl ether and dried under vacuum. The resulting polymer
was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and dialyzed against a 1:1 mixture of tetrahydrofuran and water
for 3 days and against pure water for 2 days using dialysis membranes with a molecular weight
cut-off of 6,000-8,000 g/mol (Spectrum Laboratories Inc.). Dialysis solutions were renewed
every day. Finally, the remaining aqueous solution was freeze dried, producing a viscous pink
polymer.
S2.2. RHP sequence simulation and analysis


                                                                                                 S2
S2.2.1. Simulations of RHP sequences
       An in-house program was used to perform Monte-Carlo style simulations of the
copolymerizations. We define the total number of monomers, their relative concentration ratios,
and the monomer to RAFT ratio. Then, borrowing from the Mayo-Lewis copolymerization
equation (Eq. S1, S2) (22), the reactivity ratios for each monomer with itself, along with each
other monomer are inputted. Finally, a target percent conversion is chosen that determines the
degree of polymerization of the polymers simulated.

The simulation is broken up into three steps: (i) Beginning, (ii) Growth, and (iii) Ending. A brief
discussion of each step is outline below.
   i.     Beginning
        a. The first monomer on a given chain is determined based on the relative concentration
           ratio of that monomer, e.g. if MMA is 50% of the total monomer batch, there is a 50%
           probability of MMA being the first monomer. Each chain is then initiated by an implied
           idealized initiator with no preference toward any particular monomer, by randomly
           choosing one of the monomers taking into account the aforementioned weighted
           probabilities. This is done for the total number of chains simulated as defined by the
           monomer to RAFT ratio.
  ii.     Growth
        a. Each chain is then grown based on the probability for a given monomer to add to the
           one that precedes it in the simulated chain. First, weighting factors for each chain are
           established according to the equation 𝑤 = 𝑟×[𝑀] where w is the weighting factor, r is
           the reactivity ratio for a given monomer pair, and [M] is the current concentration of the
           monomer being added. These weighting factors are normalized to produce probabilities
           for each type of addition event to occur. The chain is then grown randomly by one
           monomer based on the probabilities calculated previously, with the added monomer
           removed from the total monomer pool. This is completed for all chains, at which point
           the process loops back to the first propagation step.
 iii.     Ending
           The growth process proceeds until the targeted percent conversion is achieved.
The 4-monomer simulation was performed assuming the reactivity ratios for the methacrylic
methylene esters (OEGMA, EHMA, SPMA) to be equal and a reduced value for MMA, as
determined by Manders et al.(21) (Table S1).


                                                                                                  S3
The validity of this assumption on reactivity was supported by the conversion of the individual
monomers, as observed by 13C-NMR, which shows equal consumption of the methacrylic
methylene esters (OEGMA, EHMA, SPMA), and a lower conversion of MMA at all global
conversions as shown in Fig. S4. Fig. S5 shows the calculated sequences of 25 heteropolymer
chains. Fig. S6 shows the calculated block size distribution using 2,000 simulated
heteropolymers chains. Fig. S7 shows the monomer distribution pattern based on binary
hydrophobicity.


S2.3. Characterization of RHP
       1
         H NMR and 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) 2D NMR spectra
were carried out at 363 K with a Bruker Avance III 400 spectrometer (400 MHz for 1H and 100
MHz for 13C) using a 5 mm BBFO+ probe. Quantitative 13C NMR distortionless enhancement by
polarization transfer (DEPT135) spectra were carried out at 363 K and 100 MHz with a Bruker
Avance II 400 spectrometer using a 10 mm selective 13C SEX probe. Polymer samples were
examined as ca. 15% (w/v) solutions in N,N-dimethylformamide-d7 (DMF-d7). Chemical shift
values (δ) are given in ppm in reference to residual hydrogenated solvent. Number average (Mn)
and weight average (Mw) molar masses and dispersity (Ð = Mw/Mn) of RHP were obtained from
size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Waters 717 Plus autosampler, a 515 HPLC pump,
a 2410 differential refractometer, a 2487 UV−vis detector, a MiniDawn multiangle laser light
scattering (MALLS) detector (measurement angles are 44.7°, 90.0°, and 135.4°) from Wyatt
Technology Inc., a ViscoStar viscosity detector from Wyatt, and five Styragel HR columns
connected in the following order: 500, 103, 104, 105, and 100 Å. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was
used as the eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at room temperature. The results were processed
using the Astra 5.4 software from Wyatt Technology Inc.
       1
        H NMR spectra of RHP were used to verify that neither organic solvents nor monomer
residuals were present in the final samples. The attribution of NMR signals was performed by
comparing the 1H NMR (Fig. S8.A), quantitative 13C NMR and DEPT 13C NMR (Fig. S8.B),
and 1H-13C HSQC 2D NMR (Fig. S9) spectra with those of monomers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 2-monomer
random copolymers model analogues obtained by the copolymerization of 80 mol% of 1 and 20
mol% of either 2, 3 or 4.
        Calculating experimental monomer ratios was performed by comparing the quantitative
13
  C NMR spectra integrations of 1 at 51.86 ppm (I1), 2 at 58.43 ppm (I2), 3 at 68.74 ppm (I3) and
4 at 48.77 ppm (I4). Molar ratios of monomers 1 (i), 2 (j), 3 (k) and 4 (l) were calculated using
equations S3-S6.
                                 i = I1 / (I1 + I2 + I3 + I4)                               (S3)
                                 j = I2 / (I1 + I2 + I3 + I4)                               (S4)
                                 k = I3 / (I1 + I2 + I3 + I4)                               (S5)
                                 l = I4 / (I1 + I2 + I3 + I4)                               (S6)
RHP composition and SEC data (Fig. S10) can be found in Table S2.
S2.4. Analysis of compositional drift by varying conversion



                                                                                              S4
       A set of 12 individual batches of RHPs were made and brought to various conversions to
examine the possibility of compositional drift. All reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich
and used without further purification unless specified otherwise. Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN)
was recrystallized in ethanol prior to use. To remove inhibitors prior to polymerization, methyl
methacrylate (1) and 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate (3) were cryodistilled and ethylene glycol methyl
ether methacrylate (2) was passed over a column of basic alumina. 3-Sulfopropyl methacrylate
potassium salt (4) was used without further purification. Ethyl-2(phenylcarbanothioylthio)-2-
phenylacetate (98%) was purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Three different ratios of
monomers to RAFT agent were tested: 572:1, 286:1, 191:1, with four duplicates of each.
Reaction times were varied in order to target approximate conversions.
1. 25% Conversion Target (A1, A2, A3, A4) 4 clean 20 mL glass ampules were each charged
with 1 (0.501 g, 5.00 mmol), 2 (1.25 g, 2.50 mmol), and 3 (0.397 g, 2.00 mmol) (all added as
2.14 mL of a 5.00:2.50:2.00M 1: 2: 3 solution), 4 (123 mg, 0.500 mmol, added as 0.760 mL of a
660 mM suspension in DMF), ethyl-2(phenylcarbanothioylthio)-2-phenylacetate (5.5 mg, 0.018
mmol) and AIBN (0.8 mg, 0.005 mmol) (added as 0.38 mL of a 46 mM RAFT:13 mM AIBN
solution in DMF), trioxane (55 mg, 0.61 mmol, added as 0.090 mL of a 6.66 M solution in
DMF), and 1.63 mL of DMF to a final reaction volume of 5.0 mL.
2. 50% Conversion Target (B1, B2, B3, B4) 4 clean 20 mL glass ampules were each charged
with 1 (0.501 g, 5.00 mmol), 2 (0.125 g, 2.50 mmol), and 3 (0.397 g, 2.00 mmol) (all added as
2.14 mL of a 5.00:2.50:2.00M 1: 2: 3 solution), 4 (123 mg, 0.500 mmol, added as 0.760 mL of a
660 mM suspension in DMF), ethyl-2(phenylcarbanothioylthio)-2-phenylacetate (11 mg, 0.035
mmol) and AIBN (1.6 mg, 0.010 mmol) (added as 0.76 mL of a 46 mM RAFT:13 mM AIBN
solution in DMF), trioxane (55 mg, 0.61 mmol, added as 0.090 mL of a 6.66 M solution in
DMF), and 1.25 mL of DMF to a final reaction volume of 5.0 mL.
3. 75% Conversion Target (C1, C2, C3, C4) 4 clean 20 mL glass ampules were each charged
with 1 (0.501 g, 5.00 mmol), 2 (0.125 g, 2.50 mmol), and 3 (397 mg, 2.00 mmol) (all added as
2.14 mL of a 5.00:2.50:2.00M 1: 2: 3 solution), 4 (123 mg, 0.500 mmol, added as 0.760 mL of a
660 mM suspension in DMF), ethyl-2(phenylcarbanothioylthio)-2-phenylacetate (16.6 mg, 0.052
mmol) and AIBN (2.5 mg, 0.015 mmol) (added as 1.14 mL of a 46 mM RAFT:13 mM AIBN
solution in DMF), trioxane (55 mg, 0.61 mmol, added as 0.09 mL of a 6.66 M solution in DMF),
and 0.87 mL of DMF to a final reaction volume of 5.0 mL.
        Each reaction mixture was degassed by 4 freeze-pump-thaw cycles and the ampules were
flame sealed at 30 mtorr. The ampules were held in an 80 oC oven for the total number of hours
as listed: (A1: 18.25h A2; 18.25h A3: 2h A4: 5.8h B1: 18.25h B2: 20.3h B3:23.3h B4: 5.8h C1:
5.8h C2: 14.5h C3: 14.5h C4: 14.5h). Each viscous mixture was cooled in liquid nitrogen and
then cracked open. The polymer was precipitated by dropwise addition of the diluted mixture
into 250 mL of stirring pentane. The pink-purple precipitate was then dissolved in 10 mL of
water and transferred to a 3500 MWCO centrifuge filter. Each sample was washed 5 times via
spinning the solution down to a total volume of 2 mL and bringing it back up to 10 mL via
addition of fresh water. The resulting solution was then transferred to a vial and dried under
vacuum overnight.
       Individual monomer conversion was calculated from 13C NMR using the polymerization
solvent (DMF carbonyl at 162.37 ppm) as the internal standard. Monomers MMA (136.25 ppm)
and OEGMA (136.33 ppm) could be resolved individually. Monomers 2-EHMA and SPMA

                                                                                             S5
could not be resolved from each other (136.55 ppm) and are grouped in the calculations of the
conversion (Fig. S4).
        Global monomer conversion was calculated from the individual monomer conversions
together with the total monomer composition. Plotting the individual conversions against these
total conversions for all samples reveals a slower consumption of MMA in comparison to the
other monomers, as expected with the lower reactivity reported for MMA in copolymerizations
with methylene methacrylate esters, including OEGMA. This suggests a slight drift from the
starting monomer composition of 50% to 54-56% MMA, remaining at that level to at least 70%
conversion. This indicates a minimal drift in copolymer composition and is further corroborated
by the near-perfect overlapping in the superimposition of the 1H NMR of the purified polymers
at all conversions (Fig. S11). It should also be noted that the signal to noise increases with the
conversions yielding less exact measurements at high conversions.
Section S3. All-Atom Molecular Dynamics Simulations
S3.1. Simulations methodology
        The classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed at the all-atom
resolution using the package GROMACS (version 5.0) (33). The CHARMM 36 force field (34,
35) and the compatible CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) (36, 37) were used for all the
molecules investigated, which has already been implemented in GROMACS (34). The
CHARMM 36 force field has been well established in investigating macromolecule (both natural
and synthetic) systems (38).
        The structure of the protein HRP was downloaded from the RSCB Protein Data Bank
with the protein ID 1H55. The degree of polymerization (DP) of 80 is employed for the RHP,
which is close to the experimental molar weight of 20 kDa (DP is around 88). See Fig. S12 for
the structure of the RHP. In building a single RHP chain, random seeds were varied to match the
experimental composition ratio of MMA : 2-EHMA : OEGMA : 3-SPMA = 10 : 4 : 5 : 1.
Therefore, each polymer chain contained 40 MMA, 16 2-EHMA, 20 OEGMA and 4 3-SPMA
monomers in a random order. In total, 12 different RHP chains were built using different random
seeds so that the ratio of the concentration of polymer to that of protein matched the
experimental value. To investigate the influence of solvent on the encapsulation of proteins by
RHPs two different solvent conditions, aqueous solution and organic (toluene) solution were
studied. The compositions of the components are provided in Table S3.
       Due to the nature of long polymer chains, the encapsulation kinetics is beyond the
capability of atomistic MD simulations. Therefore, some approaches were employed to speed up
the polymer-protein aggregation process. In specific, the simulation was first performed in
vacuum condition, followed by the simulations at an elevated temperature of 400 K before the
production simulation at room temperature (298 K).
        The initial structures of the polymer-protein complex were built using the package
PACKMOL (39). The protein molecule was initially put in the center of the box with the edge
length of 15 nm in all dimensions. The 12 polymer chains were subsequently arranged
surrounding the protein with one out of the four -SO3- groups distributed within the distance of 4
nm from the center of mass of the protein molecule. Note the size of the protein molecule is
around 6 × 4 × 4 nm3. See Fig. S13.Vb for the initial structure under the vacuum condition. After
a short energy minimization using the steepest descent algorithm, the polymer-protein complex

                                                                                               S6
was simulated under vacuum conditions for a duration of 1 ns. At the end of the simulation, all
the polymer chains were aggregated surrounding the protein molecule. See Fig. S13.Ve for the
final snapshot. In the simulation under the vacuum condition, the NTV ensemble (constant
number of particles, temperature and volume) was employed via the V-rescale thermostat (the
reference temperature 400 K and the characteristic time of 0.5 ps). The backbone atoms of the
protein molecule were constrained at their initial coordinate using a force constant of 1000
KJ/mol/nm2 to maintain the structure of the protein molecule.
        Based on the final frame of the simulation under vacuum condition, the polymer-protein
complex was subsequently embedded in organic toluene solution or water solution. See Table S3
for the number of solvent molecules added, and Fig. S13.Tb and Fig. S13.Wb for the obtained
structures. They were used as the initial structures for the following simulations under the
organic or the aqueous solutions. In the following simulations, the periodic boundary conditions
were imposed in all the three dimensions; neighbor searching was performed for a distance up to
1.2 nm, and was updated every 10 time steps; the short-range van der Waals interactions using
the Lennard-Jones (LJ) 12-6 potential were truncated at 1.2 nm with the long-range dispersion
corrections applied for both the energy and the pressure; the short-range Coulomb interactions
was also truncated at 1.2 nm with the long-range interactions calculated using the smooth
Particle Mesh Ewald algorithm (40, 41). Moreover, to speed up the simulations, the simulation
time step of 2 fs was employed by constraining the covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms
using the LINCS algorithm (42, 43). To speed up the process for the optimal polymer-protein
aggregate structure, the simulations were first simulated at a temperature of 400 K, which served
as a simple means to enhance the simulation sampling of protein-polymer aggregation. The NTP
ensemble (constant number of particle, temperature and pressure) was applied with the
temperature coupled via V-rescale algorithm and the isotropic Berendsen barostat (the reference
pressure 1 bar). The simulation duration of 40 ns was performed, during which the protein
backbone atoms were again constrained to maintain the structure.
        The production simulations were subsequently performed at room temperature of 298 K.
The position restrain was switched off for the protein molecule, allowing it to fully relax for the
optimal structure. The NTP ensemble was imposed with the pressure coupled via the Parrinello-
Rahman algorithm (reference pressure 1 bar, characteristic time 4 ps, compressibility of 4.5×10-5
bar-1). The temperatures of protein, polymer and solvent (toluene, or water) were separately
coupled via the Nose-Hoover algorithm (reference temperature 298 K, characteristic time 0.5
ps). The frames were saved at a frequency of 50 ps. The toluene system was simulated for a
duration of 600 ns with the last 400 ns employed for the data analysis. The water system was
simulated 200 ns. The snapshots of the last frames were plotted in Fig. S13.Te and Fig. S13.We,
respectively.
       To justify the convergence of the all-atom MD simulations, we calculated the radius of
gyration (Rg, Fig. S14.A) and the root mean square deviation (RMSD, Fig. S14.B) of the
backbone atoms of both protein HRP and the 12 polymer chains in the toluene solution
simulations at 400 K and 298 K. Similar calculations were performed for the water solution
simulations and presented in Fig. S14(C, D). Furthermore, we calculated the system potential
energies and densities in the two systems as a function of the simulation time (Fig. S15). The
obtained results in Fig. S14 and S15 roughly support the convergence of protein-polymer
aggregation behavior in the toluene and water solution simulations. Note that longer simulations
at the microsecond or beyond, or enhanced sampling approaches (e.g., metadynamics (44, 45),

                                                                                                S7
replica-exchange (46)), could provide further evidences in terms of the convergence of the all-
atom simulations. Nevertheless, these methods are highly computationally expensive for
complex, large-length-scale simulations, like the protein-polymers aggregates investigated here.
S3.2. Control all-atom simulation justifying the CHARMM36 force field
       In addition to the three systems aforementioned, a control simulation was performed. In
the control system, one protein molecule was solved in the water solution in addition to the
ligand molecules of HEME-Fe, acetate ion, Ca2+ ions and 403 water molecules. See also Table
S3. All the simulation parameters were the same as those in the production simulations at 298 K
presented above. The convergences of the calculated secondary structures and the RMSD of the
protein backbone atoms, which are plotted in Fig. S16, justify the employment of the
CHARMM36 force field.
S3.3. Protein encapsulation
    The protein-polymer complexes are forming core-shell structures, where protein 1H55 is
encapsulated by the polymers (Fig. S17).
S3.4. Secondary structures of protein HRP
      The secondary structures of the protein 1H55 residues (Table S4) are calculated based on
the STRIDE method under the VMD package (47).
S3.5. Correlation between protein surface residues and their nearest polymer neighbors in
toluene
        To quantify the correlations between the protein surface and the surrounding polymer
monomers, the protein surface residues, as well as the surrounding polymer monomers, are
classified to be hydrophilic and hydrophobic. For the protein, the following residues are
considered as hydrophobic: ALA, GLY, ILE, LEU, MET, PHE, PRO, TRP, TYR and VAL,
while all other protein residues are considered hydrophilic. For the polymer, the MMA and 2-
EHMA monomers are considered hydrophobic, and OEGMA and 3-SPMA monomers are
hydrophilic (Fig. S12).
1) First, the protein backbone atoms on the surface are labeled by assuming that the protein is
   in the roughly spherical shape. To that end, all the protein backbone atoms are searched. An
   imaginary spherical shell of the radius of 5 nm (larger than the protein radius) is implicitly
   included based on the center of mass (COM) of the protein backbone atoms (xc, yc, zc). For
   each polymer backbone atom located at (x, y, z), the nearest position (xs, ys, zs) on the
   spherical shell is obtained based on the vector from the protein COM (xc, yc, zc) to the
   protein backbone atom (x, y, z). Then all the protein backbone atoms are searched so as to
   find the nearest one to the position on the shell (xs, ys, zs), which is consequently labeled as
   a protein surface atom. Based on all the labeled protein surface atoms, the
   hydrophilic/hydrophobic features of the protein surface are counted quantitatively. See Fig.
   S18 for the distribution of the hydrophilic (in red) and hydrophobic (in green) protein
   surface.
2) Based on the labeled protein surface atoms, those polymer tail atoms are marked which are
   the nearest-neighbors of the protein surface atoms labeled in the previous step. In these
   calculations, the last hydrocarbon atoms on the tails of MMA and 2-EHMA monomers, the
   last oxygen atoms on OEGMA and the sulfur atom on 3-SPMA monomers are employed

                                                                                                S8
    (Fig. S12). With MMA and 2-EHMA defined as hydrophobic, OEGMA and 3-SPMA
    defined as hydrophilic, the hydrophilic and hydrophobic features of the polymer neighbors
    to the labeled protein surface atoms are consequently defined. See Fig. S18 for the
    distribution of the hydrophilic (in magenta) and hydrophobic (in blue) polymer neighbors.
 3) Based on the hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature of the protein surface atoms and of their
    nearest-neighbor polymer tail atoms, the numerical probabilities of the correlations between
    the hydrophilic and hydrophobic protein surface and the hydrophilic and hydrophobic
    polymer neighbors are quantitatively calculated, and presented in Fig. S19.A.
 4) Similar to Step 3, the intermolecular (Coulomb and LJ 12-6) interaction energies between
    the protein surface residues and their polymer neighbor residues are thus calculated. The
    obtained results are provided in Fig. S19.B.


Section S4. Coarse-Grained Model and Simulations
        We developed a coarse-grained model and simulation based on the all-atom model and
results obtained from Section S4. Specifically, we took the final HRP configuration equilibrated
in toluene (Fig. S13.Te) and created a shape-based coarse-grained model using the CGBuilder
plugin in the VMD software package (48, 49). The atoms in the hydrophobic residues are coarse-
grained into 98 spherical beads and those in the hydrophilic residues into 107 spherical beads.
        The random copolymers are modeled as linear chains consisting of P = 20 beads of 4
types A, B, C and D, corresponding to monomers MMA, 2-EHMA, OEGMA and 3-SPMA,
respectively (Fig. S12). The bonds between consecutive beads in a chain are connected via
finitely extensive nonlinear elastic (FENE) springs. Despite its simplicity, the linear chain model
proves to be sufficient for qualitatively capturing the adsorbing behavior of the polymers on the
protein surface observed in our all-atom MD simulations and experiment.
        In developing the present CG model, we choose to focus on the competition between the
short-ranged attractions between polymer beads and between polymer beads, leaving
electrostatic interactions for future studies. This is reasonable for the present study because the
fraction of the charged residues on the HRP surface under experimental conditions is presumably
small. As such, the interaction between the adsorbing polymer beads (i.e. of types A and B) and
polymer attractive sites is modeled by the 12-6 Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, of which the
energy well depth, εHh, characterizes the adsorption strength. The solvent selectivity is modeled
by the effective attraction between the polymer beads of types A and B themselves via the LJ
potential with the energy well depth εhh. The LJ potentials are truncated and shifted to zero at the
cutoff distance of 3.0σ. The effective interactions between other bead types are modeled by the
purely repulsive Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) potential.
        The CG simulations are performed at constant temperature and volume using the
Langevin thermostat. The solvent molecules and counterions are treated implicitly and their
effects are modeled by the random and drag forces applied to individual beads by the Langevin
thermostat. The equation of motion of individual CG beads is governed by:
                                            ma = FC + FD + FR
where m and a are the bead mass and acceleration, respectively; FC is the conservative force, FD
= -γv is the drag force, and FR is the random force, whose magnitude is proportional to

                                                                                                 S9
(kBTγ/Δt)1/2 according to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The simulation time step is Δt =
0.005τ, where t is the dimensionless time unit τ = σ(m/ε)1/2, where m = 1 is the mass of the CG
beads and ε = 1 is the energy well depth of the WCA potential. The dimensionless set
temperature is T* = kBT/ε = 1.0. All the CG simulations were performed using LAMMPS version
20 Sep 2016 (50).
        The protein is located at the center of the cubic simulation box whose dimension is L =
65σ with periodic boundary conditions. The protein beads are constrained to their equilibrated
configurations via harmonic springs to ensure that the global structure of the protein is
maintained while taking into account the effects of thermal fluctuations due to implicit solvent
and counterion bombardments. We vary the number of polymer chains NC = 12, 50 and 100, to
cover the molar ratios used in experiment and that in all-atom MD simulation (NC = 12). The
total number of CG beads varies from N = 445 to 2205. The random order of the monomers
within the chains is generated by two methods: 1) the bead types are shuffled within individual
chains and 2) the bead types are shuffled within the total number of polymer beads. The first
method is used when the number of chains NC is sufficiently large, e.g. NC = 50 and 100. The
second method is used when the number of chains is small, i.e. NC = 12, so as to improve the
randomness in the monomer order. The compositions of beads of types B and D are always fixed
at 0.2 and 0.05, respectively, consistent with those in full-atom MD simulations. When the
composition of beads of type A, φA, is varied, the composition of beads of type C is adjusted
accordingly to ensure that φA + φB + φC + φD = 1.
        To accelerate the sampling of the adsorption process by MD simulations, we constrain all
the polymer chains within a spherical volume of radius Rc using harmonic springs (i.e. using the
command fix indent in LAMMPS). The value of Rc is chosen so that the number density of the
polymer beads in the spherical confinement is fixed at 0.1σ-3 for all the polymer-protein molar
ratios studied. The choice of such a number density is motivated by our all-atom MD simulations
and experimental conditions.
         To ascertain that the simulation results are not biased by initial configurations, we vary
the random seeds used to generate the random polymer chains and the initial velocity profiles of
the polymer beads. To further improve the statistics of the simulation results, we perform
annealing/equilibrating cycles for each data point (Fig. S20A). During the annealing period, the
interaction between the polymer attractive sites and polymer adsorbing beads is switched to the
purely repulsive WCA potential so that the system is annealed at the athermal condition before
being equilibrated again. In addition to monitoring the system potential energy, we also measure
the average number of adsorbing polymer sites in the vicinity of each attractive site (Fig. S20.B)
to justify if the equilibration reaches steady state. At the end of the equilibration period, the final
configuration is then collected for analyzing surface coverage, pair correlation functions and
radial density profiles. By using annealing/equilibrating cycles, we attempt to avoid kinetically
trapped configurations with strong attractions, as well as to obtain statistically uncorrelated final
configurations.
        We have also run additional Hamiltonian exchange simulations to assure the system is
equilibrated at equilibrium. In the Hamiltonian exchange simulations, we used 16 replicas each
assigned with an adsorption strength εHh in the range of 0.3-1.8 kBT. A trial swap in εHh between
adjacent replicas is attempted every 104 time steps. The swap is accepted or rejected using a
Metropolis-like criterion (1). A replica-exchange simulation for a given value of φA is performed

                                                                                                  S10
for 50 million time steps. The configurations obtained at each value of εHh are then collected at
the end of the run from the replicas for surface coverage analysis. The results from the
Hamiltonian exchange runs are indeed consistent with those obtained from the heating/cooling
procedure, as already reported.
        We estimate surface coverage Γ from particle-based molecular simulation data as
follows. First, the protein beads that interact with the polymer beads are identified. The
maximum distance from the protein beads to the center of mass of the protein rmax is then
calculated. Next, we construct a spherical volume of radius (rmax + rc) centered at the protein
center of mass, and divide the spherical surface into Ncells with equal areas so that the dimension
of each cell is approximately σ. The polymer beads that are within the spherical volume are then
binned into the cells based on their coordinates. The ratio between the number of the occupied
cells and the total number of cells Ncells gives the approximate measure of surface coverage Γ.
        Fig. S21 shows the representative final configurations for different adsorption strengths,
εHh, when the attraction between the beads of type A and B is fixed at εhh = 0.8kBT and the
fraction of A is φA = 0.5.
        Fig. S22.A demonstrates that the pair correlation functions between adsorbed polymer
beads for different fractions of the adsorbing components φA and between the attractive sites of
the protein. The increase in the peak height of the pair correlation function with φA strongly
correlates with the surface coverage, suggesting that the polymer adsorbed beads are more likely
to match the distribution of protein attractive sites upon increasing the composition of the
adsorbing components.
        Our simulation results reveal that surface coverage increases with the polymer-ratio
molar ratio (Fig. S22.B) for all the adsorption strength studied. This is because NC is proportional
to the number of adsorbing beads, which to a certain degree have similar effects to increasing φA.
        The structural properties of the polymer chains are investigated and shown in Fig. S23.
The variation in the number of adsorbed polymer chains, nads, as functions of φA and adsorption
strength εHh is shown in Fig. S23.A. Upon increasing φA, nads increases because there are more
adsorbing polymer beads, as expected. Nevertheless, at higher values of φA, nads is reduced for
strong attractions between polymer beads of types A and B. The strong correlation between nads
and surface coverage Γ (Fig. 2.H) can be explained as follows. In the one hand, nads is
proportional to the energetically favored polymer-protein contacts governed by the adsorption
strength. Consequently, nads, and hence Γ, increases with φA and the density and distribution of
the protein attractive sites. On the other hand, nads characterizes with the entropic loss due to the
surface confinement of the chains, compared to those that are not adsorbed. The entropic loss is
reduced when εhh increases because the polymer beads of types A and B that are not non-
adsorbed tend to aggregate. The optimal value of Γ and the maximum value of nads are then
attributed to the competition between the tendency of the polymers to avoid entropic loss due to
confinement to the surface and their tendency to maximize their energetically favored contacts.
        Fig. S23.B shows the pair correlation functions of the adsorbing beads and polymer
attractive sites for different adsorption strengths, which are consistent with the findings from our
all-atom MD simulations in Section S3. Fig. S23.C further shows the radial density profiles of
the polymer beads from the protein center of mass for different adsorption strengths. The peak of
the density profiles shifts to higher values and gets closer to the protein surface as εHh increases.

GFPe_PepTSo was a gift from So Iwata & Simon Newstead (Addgene plasmid # 58334). The
GFP tag in the plasmid was removed to generate a plasmid pWaldo-PepTso for protein function
assay by QB3 MarcoLab (University of California, Berkeley). Plasmid Aqpz-GFP was a gift
from Prof. Daniel L. Minor, Jr. (University of California, San Francisco). DOPC, POPE and

from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase secondary antibody
conjugate was purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories.
       Cell-free protein synthesis. Cell-free protein synthesis was performed according to
PURExpress manual with modifications. Briefly, in a 25 µl reaction, RHP was added to the
ribosome solution in a ratio of 50/1 (mole/mole), and incubated on ice for 30 min. The
polymer/ribosome samples were mixed with solution A and B containing all other required
enzymes, RNAs, energy and nutrient molecules. 20 units RNase inhibitor and 200 ng plasmids
for PepTso-GFP, PepTso, or AqpZ-GFP were added, and the mixtures were incubated at 37 oC
for 3 hours to complete membrane protein synthesis. The resulting samples were stored at -20
o
  C.
        Kinetics of protein synthesis and Western blot analysis. Kinetics of PepTso-GFP and
AqpZ-GFP cell-free synthesis were monitored through measuring the fluorescence intensity of
the GFP tag on a Tecan I-control infinite 200 plate reader. Cell-free protein synthesis mixtures
were incubated in 384-well plate at 37 oC, and the GFP fluorescence (Ex/Em 480 nm/520 nm)
was recorded over 3 hours. For the western blot, proteins in the cell-free protein synthesis
samples were first separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE). Lane 1 corresponds to protein mass standards. (Spectra multicolor broad range
protein ladder, (ThermoFisher)) The proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to a
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Multicolor protein mass standards were visible on
the membrane after successful transfer. The membrane was then blocked with 3 % BSA,
incubated with 1:2000 mouse anti-GFP antibody, and washed. Following incubation with 1:4000
alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, band colors were
developed by using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) and nitroblue tetrazolium
(NBT).
        Reconstitution of membrane protein and transport assay. The preparation of
POPE/POPG (3/1) proteoliposomes containing PepTso was performed following the reported
method with modifications (26). Briefly, to prepare liposomes, chloroform in lipid was
evaporated, and resulting lipid film was further dried under vacuum overnight. Dried lipid film
was solubilized at 10 mg/mL in an inner solution (5 mM HEPES pH 6.8, 1.2 mM NaCl, 120 mM
KCl, 2 mM MgSO4, 1 mM pyranine) at 37 oC for 1 hour. 10 µL of the cell-free PepTso synthesis
mixtures was added to 500 µL of the liposomes solutions, which was then subjected to 6 cycles
of freeze/thaw using liquid nitrogen and 37 oC water bath. The resulting proteoliposomes were

                                                                                            S12
extruded 10 times through 0.4 µm membranes at 37 oC. Excess pyranine was removed through a
sephadex G-25 desalting column using the inner solution without pyranine. Before proton and
oligopeptide transport assay, samples containing the proteoliposomes were diluted 20 folds in the
outer solution (5 mM HEPES pH 6.8, 1.2 mM KCl, 120 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgSO4) containing
0.2 mM dipeptide Ala-Ala. 1 µM valinomycin was added to the outer solution to initiate the
proton transport. Proton transport was measured by reading the ratio of pyranine fluorescence at
510 nm when excited at 460 and 415 nm (52) in a cuvette with a stirring magnetic flea, on a
Perkin Elmer LS55 Fluorescence spectrometer.
        Horseradish peroxidase type II (HRP, Sigma-Aldrich) and glucose oxidase type II (GOx,
Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in Milli-Q water (Millipore) to a concentration of 10 mg/mL. α-
chymotrypsin (α-CT, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 0.1 M Tris-HCl with 1 mM CaCl2, pH
7.75, to a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Upon arrival of green fluorescent protein (GFP,
Millipore), GFP was centrifuge filtrated to remove salts and glycerol using Amicon Ultra-0.5 mL
centrifugal filters (Millipore) with a cutoff molecular weight of 10 kDa. GFP was then dissolved
in Milli-Q water to a concentration of approximately 1 mg/mL. Organophosphorus hydrolase
(OPH) was expressed, based on established procedure. The enzyme was stored in a 50 mM Tris-
HCl buffer, pH 9, at a concentration of 1.5 mg/mL. RHPs were dissolved in Milli-Q water at a
concentration of 1 mg/mL. Sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT, Aldrich) was
dissolved in toluene at a concentration of 200 mM. Polymeric surfactant, polystyrene(22kDa)-
block-poly(ethylene oxide) (21.5kDa) (PS-b-PEO), was purchased from Polymer Source and was
dissolved in toluene at a concentration of 1 mg/mL.
        To prepare reverse micelles, HRP solutions were injected into AOT solution at a
[H2O]/[AOT] ratio of w0=13 or injected into PS-b-PEO at a volumetric ratio of 1:50 HRP
solution to polymer solution. The suspensions were sonicated, mixed, and partially evaporated
using a constant stream of N2 gas until optically clear. Additional toluene was added to
compensate for evaporated solvent in order to reobtain original concentrations. Protein/RHP
complexes were obtained by combining the aqueous RHP solution and protein solution at a
volume ratio of 50:1. RHP/protein mixtures were lyophilized overnight, resuspended with
toluene to the original concentration, and subsequently sonicated. Other than GFP, all materials
were used as received.
S5.2. Structural characterization
        Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) RHP-HRP complexes were drop casted on
TEM carbon grids (Ted Pella) and dried for 5 minutes. Subsequently, several drops of water
were used to wash off excess free polymer. Samples were stained using a 2 w/v% solution of
phosphotungstic acid in water for 2 minutes. TEM images were taken on a JEOL 1200EX TEM
at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. In toluene HRP/RHP forms nanoparticles, ~50 nm in size.
        Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) To enhance the signal-to-noise
ratio, solutions of HRP/RHP complex were concentrated to reach a HRP concentration of ~8-10
mg/mL. Solutions were deposited in a liquid cell composed of CaF2 windows with a path length
of 1 mm. Spectra were collected at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after resuspension in toluene on a
Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700. Measurements were conducted at room temperature and the
amide I band between 1700 cm-1 and 1620 cm-1 was monitored. Spectral analysis was performed
using the built-in OMNIC Spectra Software.


                                                                                             S13
        UV-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-Vis) UV-visible spectroscopy was performed on a
Hewlett-Packard 8453 Spectrophotometer. HRP/RHP complex solutions in toluene were sealed
in a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette. Measurements were conducted at room temperature and the
location of the hemin peak was monitored between 350 nm and 800 nm at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 24
hours after resuspension.
        Fluorescent Spectroscopy Retention of GFP fluorescence was evaluated using a Perkin
Elmer LS-55 fluorescence spectrometer. Immediately after dissolving GFP/RHP in toluene,
solutions were sealed in a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette and excited at an excitation
wavelength of 450 nm. Emission wavelength was monitored between 450 nm and 600 nm.
Measurements were conducted at room temperature and taken at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after
resuspension in toluene.
S5.3. Assay of protein activity in aqueous buffer
        Solutions were left in ambient room temperature conditions for 0, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours in
toluene. After specified times, aliquots were taken and diluted in 100 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4
phosphate buffer, pH 6, to disperse the protein and RHP. After thorough mixing, the assay
solution is applied. Activity was quantified using UV-visible spectroscopy by monitoring the
conversion of the colorimetric assay.
       HRP activity was assessed using a TMB Peroxidase EIA Substrate Kit (Bio-Rad).
Baseline HRP activity was determined by preparing a stock protein solution in 100 mM
KH2PO4/K2HPO4 phosphate buffer at pH 6 and applying a prepared TMB assay solution, as
outlined by the manufacturer. Solution was thoroughly mixed and UV-visible spectroscopy was
performed on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 Spectrophotometer. A 1-cm path length cuvette was used
and absorbance at 370 nm was monitored.
        GOx activity was assessed using an assay containing glucose, phenol, 4-
aminoantipyrine, and HRP. Baseline GOx activity was determined by preparing a stock protein
solution in 100 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4 phosphate buffer at pH 6 and applying the colorimetric
assay. A 1-cm path length cuvette was used and absorbance at 505 nm was monitored.
        OPH activity was assessed using an assay containing methyl parathion. Baseline OPH
activity was determined by preparing a stock protein solution in 50 mM TRIS-HCl buffer and
applying the colorimetric assay. OPH activity was monitored using a Thermo Fisher Scientific
NanoDrop 2000 at 405 nm.
S5.4. Evaluation of RHP-assisted protein dispersion and stabilization for other proteins
        GFP Similar experiments were performed using GFP and fluorescence was monitored as
a function of incubation time in toluene (Fig. S27).
       GOx PEGylation was performed following the procedure reported previously. (28) The
feeding ratio of PEG was adjusted to increase PEGylation.


S5.5. Protein-containing fiber mats
      Electrospinning For PMMA based electrospun fiber mats, poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA, Sigma-Aldrich) (MW=350,000 g/mol) was first dissolved in chloroform to achieve a 7.5
wt% solution concentration. 200 µL of toluene containing the protein/RHP complex was mixed

                                                                                              S14
with 800 µL of the PMMA/chloroform solution. For present studies, the protein concentration in
the fiber mat is typically in the range of 0.3-0.5 wt%. The mixture was stirred for 5 minutes at
350 RPM immediately prior to electrospinning. The solution was then electrospun from a 1 mL
syringe and a 20 gauge needle. An aluminum collector plate was placed 18 cm away from the
needle tip in a horizontal setup. The solution was pumped at a rate of 0.45 mL/hr. A voltage of 8
kV was applied to the solution. For PEO-based fiber mats, OPH-RHP was lyophilized and
resuspended directly into a 5.5 wt% PEO (Mw = 900,000 g/mol) in MilliQ water solution. A flat
aluminum collector plate was placed 20 cm from the needle tip. An accelerating voltage of 9 kV
was applied to the solution, which was pumped at a flow rate of 0.35 mL/hr.
       Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) A Hitachi TM-1000 scanning electron
microscope was used to acquire images of the electrospun fibers. The samples were mounted on
conductive carbon tape. A 15 kV accelerating voltage was used to acquire the SEM images.
        Assay of OPH Activity in Electrospun Fibers Protein/RHP-loaded fiber mats were
tested in the same aqueous buffer used to measure activity of free proteins. The activity was
monitored visually by the solution color change. A protein loading of approximately 1 µg of
OPH per 1 mg of polymer was achieved.
