Chemical Space of the Seed Dataset




Fig. S1| Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the seed dataset. The data is projected onto the first
three principal components and shown in panel (a). Panels (b), (c), (d) add jitter to the data presented in panel A and are
colored with the retained enzyme activities (REAs) measured for GOx, Lip, and HRP, respectively.


The seed dataset, represented using DP-explicit composition vectors, was mean centered and scaled to
unit variance before performing principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The
data is projected onto the first three components, capturing 52% variation in the data, and displayed in
Fig. S1a, revealing the systematic nature of the seed dataset construction. The first principal component
(PC1), explaining the greatest source of variance in the seed dataset, is exclusively a linear combination
of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and butyl methacrylate (BMA) fractions of incorporation. Increasing PC1
corresponds to increasing MMA and decreasing BMA incorporations; symmetry about PC1 = 0 indicates
a number of nearly identical datapoints where the only difference is the reversal in MMA and BMA
incorporations. Notably, PC1-3 contain variation from all monomer fractions of incorporations but lack
any representation of degree of polymerization. Jitter added to the data shown in Fig. S1a is presented
in Fig. S1b-d, revealing that many seed datapoints are compositionally identical but vary in DP.
Interestingly, Fig. S1b-d suggest that particular regions of the chemical space are associated with
particularly high REAs for each of the enzymes, with very few instances of isolated high-performers.
Consistent with the results presented in Fig. 2d-f and Fig. S2a-c, these regions appear distinct for each
of the enzymes, suggesting that distinct chemistries are responsible for their stabilization.
Fig. S2a-c presents the seed dataset again in reduced dimensions, but in this case are hand-crafted to
hold chemical significance and are relatively easily interpreted. The ternary plots are colored by the
highest measured REA of a PPH formed with a copolymer of composition given by a point in the chemical
space; interpolative methods are used to color points between assayed regions. Comparison to Fig. 2d-
f, which includes data obtained from the active learning campaigns, visually conveys the 1) improvement
of REA seen from PPHs formed with copolymers suggested by the active learning, particularly in the
case of GOx and Lip, and 2) the fine tuning of the REA – chemical space landscape formed from the
initial seed dataset. The appearance of vast regions of the copolymer chemical space viable for HRP
stabilization shown in Fig. S2c is slightly misleading considering the extent of the space over which
interpolation takes place. Notably, the 504 copolymers constituting the seed dataset leave much of the
chemical space unsampled, including the region where many of the top performing copolymers for Lip.
stabilization come from. Despite this, iterations of active learning identify and exploit this region for
polymer design.

of a copolymer found within a given region in the chemical space, thus accounting for overlaps. Extrapolative coloring
is performed with linear barycentric interpolation.

Copolymer Featurization and Initial Modeling
Copolymers were numerically encoded as a weighted average of
“fingerprint” vectors representing individual monomers, where the
weights are set in proportion to the monomers’ fraction of
incorporations within the polymer being represented. One-hot
encoding (OHE), Morgan fingerprints (MFP), and vectors of chemical
descriptors (CD), some computed using density functional theory
(DFT), were all probed as potential fingerprints used to represent
monomers in the polymer featurization strategy.
The OHE is a 𝑛 − bit vector, n being the number of unique monomer
types (8 in this case), where a “1” in a particular bit corresponds to
the indication of a particular monomer type. The remaining bits
populated with “0”. MFP represent monomers as a collection of
chemical structures, encoding their presence and absence with “1s”
and “0s”, respectively. The vector of chemical descriptors includes
molecular weight, nuclear repulsion energy, dispersion correction
energy, total energy, and dipole magnitude, the latter four being
mean quantities computed with DFT for all conformers found using
in-house code.
Linear, Gaussian process regression (GPR), and neural network
(NN) models were trained to predict REA for each of the three
enzymes from polymer representations (Fig. S3). Notably, predictive
performance is insensitive to the identity of the chemical fingerprint
used to encode monomer identity for any given model type and
enzyme. It is likely that much of the variation in REA can be explained
by variation in composition between copolymers, which is encoded
in the featurization strategy regardless of the fingerprint used.
Furthermore, any potential performance gain in using chemically
informed monomer representations is likely masked by noise in the
REA measurements. For this reason, the simple OHE was chosen
to represent monomers in the polymer featurization strategy. Using
this strategy, polymer representations amounted to 8-dimensional
vectors, where each dimension contains the fraction of incorporation
of a particular monomer. Representations are then appended with a
max-normalized value of the DP, resulting in a final 9-dimensional Fig. S3| Boxplots showing the distribution
vector.                                                                 of coefficients of determinations obtained

model can likely be attributed to the relatively limited size of the seed
datasets. Due to its demonstrated superior predictive performance and ability to robustly quantify
uncertainty in such predictions, GPR was chosen to model PPH REA for all enzymes.

REA Distributions Through Iterations of Design

Fig. S4 depicts general upward trend in median REA of copolymers discovered at iterative stages of the
active learning. In all cases, median REAs of polymers constituting the exploit iteration of all design
campaigns are greater than those found at any previous iteration of design.

Upon completion of the active learning, it was found that none of the polymer candidates identified by the
active learning for HRP had REAs above 100%. This result was surprising considering four polymers
from the seed dataset were observed to pass this threshold, one even reaching an REA of 167%.
Suspected to be outliers, the four polymers were resynthesized and characterized. Table S1 shows the
initial REA measurement used to label the four polymers in model training and their re-measured values.
Unsurprisingly, all remeasured REAs were lower than their initial measurements, albeit in larger-than-
expected amounts. To better understand potential implications on the active learning, the HRP REA
models trained at every iteration we used to predict the REA of these four polymers. In all four cases, the
REA predicted by the seed model and all following models is substantially lower than the label it was
trained to predict and closer to the remeasured value, indicating the GPR model’s robustness to noise.
This robustness likely reduced the impact of these erroneous points in guiding the AL through chemical
space.

peak region. c-d. 1H NMR triplicate polymerizations (M = pre-polymerization, P = post-polymerization) of EP1.

Upon selection of EP1-HRP for further analysis through biophysical characterization, we characterized
EP1 by size-exclusion chromatography and 1H NMR. As EP1 is composed of 13% 2-HPMA, 12% SPMA,
53% MMA, and 22% TMAEMA (mol %), with a target DP of 75, EP1’s theoretical molecular weight (MW)
= 10790 g/mol. While measured MW was lower than anticipated (Measured Mn = 5802 g/mol, Mw = 6866
g/mol) (Fig. S5a-b), the use of aqueous GPC calibrated by PEG standards may create discrepancies
between expected and measured MW. While polymerization of EP1 demonstrated excellent reaction
control (Ð = 1.18), to confirm robust polymerization, further analysis by 1H NMR (Fig. S5c-d) triplicate
polymerizations (M = pre-polymerization, P = post-polymerization) of EP1 demonstrate >99.9%
conversion over 16hr polymerizations as observed from the complete loss of methacrylic peaks at 5.5 -
6.0 ppm and the appearance of peaks at 0.5 - 1.0 ppm indicative of polymer backbone. These results
suggest complete polymerization of EP1.

Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy:
Table S2| Secondary structures of HRP-EP1 during thermal stress.




CD spectra collected were analyzed using CDNN software which uses neural network algorithms to
estimate the secondary structure of proteins using data from a trained set of proteins.2 Utilizing CDNN,
the secondary structure of HRP and HRP-EP1 were estimated and wavelength range between 205-260
nm was selected to reduce the error associated from salts present in buffers at lower wavelengths.

Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS):
To observe the changes in the physical conformation of HRP, EP1, and HRP-EP1 from pre-heat to post-
heat conditions, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was performed on all samples. To obtain
information about molecular size, Guinier analysis, pair distance distribution functions, and Kratky
analysis were completed to calculate Rg, Dmax, and gauge sample compactness (Table S3). First,
Guinier analysis was performed to calculate Rg of HRP, EP1, and HRP-EP1 before and after heating.
Fig. S6 shows the lines of best fit for all samples ranging from scattering angles q min = 0.012 Å-1 to qmax
= 0.05 Å-1. HRP, EP1, and HRP-EP1 demonstrated single species populations as measured by SAXS
with Rg determined by Guinier analysis ranging from 24.6-27.2 Å. Upon exposure to heat, HRP exhibited
an increased Rg of 51.9 Å by Guinier analysis with an upward slope at low q indicative of aggregation or
denaturation. In contrast, heating did not induce as drastic of a shift in EP1 and HRP-EP1 which post
heating exhibited Guinier Rg of 26.0 and 26.9 Å respectively. This evidence is further supported by the
pair distance distribution functions and calculated Rg which suggest the development of a highly extended
HRP after thermal stress (Rg = 60.6 Å) whereas HRP-EP1 maintains a more conserved size (Rg = 27.7
Å) relative to HRP before thermal stress (Rg = 24.3 Å). This is clear indication of the presence of a single
population both before and after heating, indicating that HRP-EP1 maintained much of its conformational
integrity after heating similar to that of native HRP. Furthermore, to observe whether the complexation of
HRP with EP1 could form a compact structure, we utilized Kratky analysis to qualitatively assess the
PPH’s compactness in comparison to the native protein. Fig. S7 shows the Kratky plots in which both
HRP and HRP-EP1 demonstrate strong peaks at scattering angles q = 0.065 (Å-1) and q = 0.075 (Å-1)
respectively that is indicative of compactness.



Table S3| Characterization of HRP, EP1, and HRP-EP1 by SAXS. Rg were determined by Guiner analysis, and R2 was
calculated based on the corresponding linear fit. Further, maximum dimension (Dmax) was calculated by evaluation of the
pairwise distribution function in BioXTAS.

Penalty Function
Upon application of the diversity filter, it was found that only 19 sufficiently diverse candidates could be
identified from the 200 proposed at iteration one of active learning for Lip. Although the acquisition
function is varied between each of the proposals by changing the explore-exploit hyperparameter 𝜉 along
a logarithmically spaced interval, meaning each of the 200 candidates is a theoretically unique and
optimal solution, it is likely that small variations in 𝜉 lead to proximate optima. Accordingly, a penalty
function was used to bias against proposing candidates within experimental error of candidates
synthesized in the seed database, those found in any previous iteration of active learning, and those
previously proposed within a given round of active learning. The form of the penalty function is given by:

                                                            𝑑
       𝑃(𝑥⃑) = 100 × 𝐻(𝑑 − 0.05√2) × (1 − tanh (0.05√2                ) , 𝑑 = min(‖𝑥⃑ − 𝑥⃑𝑖 ‖2 ) , 𝑥⃑𝑖 ∈ {𝐴}
                                                                −1.
                                                        10


where 𝑥⃑ is the point in the feature space in question and 𝑥⃑𝑖 is an element of the set {𝐴} of avoided points.
The quantity 0.05√2 is used to penalize polymers that differ by less than 0.05 in the fraction of
incorporation of a given monomer type given that the Hamilton MLSTARlet liquid handling robot
dispenses reagents to within ~5% error. The geometric distance between feature vectors was computed
excluding the bit containing the DP representation; points within the penalty threshold of elements of {𝐴}
but differing in DP were not penalized. The penalty tends to ~102 as points approach the aforementioned
penalized points and ~10-6 at a distance of 0.07 away from them; the penalty function would not act
outside this distance threshold. The penalty is calculated by considering only the closest penalizing-point
at a given position in the feature space. Use of a density-based penalty that simultaneously accounted
for all elements of {𝐴} at all points of the feature space was explored, however, it was found that “optimal
candidates” identified with BO with use of this density-based penalty function had extreme sensitivity to
the length scale over which the penalty propagated from a given point. Too large of a length scale biased
candidates away from optimal regions; too small and not enough diverse candidates would be proposed.
Fig. S10 shows the distribution of pairwise distances less than 0.07 between each unique pair of the 200
candidates produced with and without use of the penalty function at iteration one of active learning for
each enzyme. In all three cases, the penalty function aided in biasing proposed candidates away from
one another on length-scales in feature space on order with experimental error and ultimately aided in
producing diverse candidates at every round of active learning. This was found particularly helpful for Lip

For iterations 2-5, the penalty function was adopted to bias optimal candidates away from points in the
chemical space observed or predicted to gel.

Classifier Implementation
20 of the 24 iteration-four polymer candidates for GOx stabilization were found to phase separate into
liquid and gel phases. Outside of the penalty function, the GPR model and Bayesian Optimization
algorithm are agnostic to polymer phase behavior, motivating the development of an additional model
that could be used to avoid areas of the chemical space prone to gelling. In the spirit of data-driven / ML
lead design this was framed as a classification problem, where a model was trained to predict the binary
outcome of “gelling or non-gelling”.

For simplicity, the classifier was trained using the same polymer representations used to train the GPR
model, though, investigation of model performance using alternative representations is a worthy future
pursuit. Initial investigations of multiple classifiers with minimal hyperparameter tuning suggested that a
Random Forrest Classifier (RFC) would perform well for the task and was the basis for further model
development. Table S5 provides details of tuned hyperparameters for the RFC model.
Notably, the available data to train the initial classifier was largely imbalanced, with only 15% of the
datapoints corresponding to gelled polymers. To combat this issue and avoid the model learning to only
predict a “non-gelling” outcome, it was found imperative to follow three particular strategies in designing
the classifier. First was using the balanced accuracy score, defined as the average recall of a classifier
for each class, as the metric of interest for model selection. The balanced accuracy score for a model
that predicts only “non-gelling” is quite low compared to models that can predict nearly equally as well for
either class. Second, it was found important to reweight the class importance to be inversely proportional
to its frequency in the dataset during model training. Lastly, as Table S5 shows, treating the probability
threshold for classification as a hyperparameter allowed for models to be more conservative when
predicting a sample to be “non-gelling”. The latter two strategies facilitated the training and selection of
models that maximized the balanced accuracy score. The Tree-structured Parzen Estimator Approach
(TPE) was again used to identify model hyperparameters that maximized the mean balanced accuracy
scored obtained through K=5 fold-cross validation over the full dataset. The final RFC model was then
trained with the entirety of the dataset and using ideal hyperparameters.
Shapely Additive Explanation (SHAP) analysis was used to better understand gelling behavior by looking
at how monomer fraction of incorporations in a given polymer affected classifier predictions. As Fig. S11
shows, PEGMA, DMAEAEMA, and SPMA were largely the most influential features used by the RFC in
making a prediction. In line with physical expectation, the classifier learned to associate polymers with
relatively more the hydrophilic monomer-type PEGMA with larger probabilities of solubility, and likewise,
polymers with relatively less PEGMA with larger probabilities of gelling. In a similar fashion, the classifier
associated polymers with larger fraction of incorporations of hydrophobic monomer type DMEAEMA with


                                                        15
larger probabilities of gelling; smaller fractions of incorporations of DMEAEMA had a smaller impact on
model predictions, though, were generally associated with higher probabilities of solubility.




          Fig. S11| SHAP summary values for the random forest gelation classifier. The features displayed are those
          retained from the feature selection during model selection. Negative SHAP values are interpreted as
          predicted probabilities towards gelation.

Comparing Fig. S11 and Fig. 3e, one finds that feature values associated with predictions of solubility
are often associated with predictions of lower REA. For example, large fractions of incorporations of
PEGMA are predicted to increase the probability of solubility but are detrimental to predictions on REA.
A similar effect can be seen with SPMA. Equally problematic, feature values that are associated with
predictions of gelling are associated with higher predictions of GOx REA. For example, larger fractions
of incorporation of DMEAEMA lead to larger predictions in REA but are strongly linked to predictions of
gelation. Thus, there is an apparent tradeoff between solubility and REA for polymers for GOx
stabilization.
The classifier was deployed to avoid proposing gelling polymer candidates for iterations four (a retry) and
five of the GOx campaign, albeit in varying capacities. For iteration four, the classifier acted as a
screening tool: as each of the 200 candidates were proposed by the BO algorithm, the classifier would
predict whether the candidate would gel or not. If the candidate was predicted to gel, a scaling penalty
would be added in the region of the feature space of that particular polymer. The acquisition function
would then be re-maximized, taking into account the penalty placed in the formerly optimal position in
chemical space. This process is continued until an optimal candidate for a given value of 𝜉 is identified
that is predicted to not gel. While the classifier was successful in reducing the number of gelling
candidates from 20/24 (w/o classifier) to only 7/24 (w/classifier) for iteration four of the active learning,
there were two potential shortcomings identified with its use screening tool. Firstly, polymer candidates
from iteration four of the GOx campaign, while exhibiting high REAs relative to those from the seed
database, were underwhelming compared to many polymers found in iteration three. While use of the
classifier was key in identifying many non-gelling, high performing polymers, it is possible that many
globally top performing polymers proposed by BO were simultaneously at high-risk for gelling and
ultimately rejected by the classifier. This is likely since polymer chemistries responsible for gelation and
GOx stabilization were found to be related.
Secondly, a related issue, the Bayesian optimization algorithm was still agnostic to gelling behavior when
selecting optimal candidates, outside of small regions in the chemical space where polymers have either

                                                           16
been previously observed or predicted to gel. Accordingly, since the same polymer chemistries were
largely responsible for gelation and GOx stabilization, a significant number of candidates suggested by
BO were rejected by the classifier and was thus a computationally inefficient approach. An alternative
approach considered was to first screen the chemical space and restrict the bounds of the optimization
to only consider predicted non-gelling regions as a viable domain. However, due to the high
dimensionality of the feature space and their complex interactions, putting definitive bounds on the
domain was deemed unreliable. Furthermore, such agnosticism is likely what caused 7/24 polymers to
gel despite all being predicted to not gel. A simple Bayes’ rule argument, expanded in the following
equations and plotted in Fig. S12, shows that even the most successful classifier will fail if presented with
predominantly gelling polymers:
                                         𝑃(𝑇 = 𝐺𝑒𝑙 |𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑 = 𝑁𝑜𝑡 𝑔𝑒𝑙)
                                  𝑃(𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑. = 𝑁𝑜𝑡 𝐺𝑒𝑙 | 𝑇 = 𝐺𝑒𝑙) 𝑃(𝑇 = 𝐺𝑒𝑙)
     =
         𝑃(𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑. = 𝑁𝑜𝑡 𝐺𝑒𝑙 | 𝑇 = 𝐺𝑒𝑙) 𝑃(𝑇 = 𝐺𝑒𝑙) + 𝑃(𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑. = 𝑁𝑜𝑡 𝐺𝑒𝑙 | 𝑇 = 𝑁𝑜𝑡 𝐺𝑒𝑙) 𝑃(𝑇 = 𝑁𝑜𝑡 𝐺𝑒𝑙)
                                              𝐹𝑁𝑅 ∗ 𝑃(𝑇 = 𝐺𝑒𝑙)
                                =
                                    𝐹𝑁𝑅 ∗ 𝑃(𝑇 = 𝐺𝑒𝑙) + 𝑇𝑁𝑅 (1 − 𝑃(𝑇 = 𝐺𝑒𝑙))
The false positive rate (FNR) and true negative
rate (TNR) of the classifier are estimated to be
0.075 and 0.78 respectively (means obtained
through K=5 cross validation). P(T = Gel) is the
proportion of gelling candidates in the
population of candidates suggested by BO for
GOx at iteration four, which can be estimated to
be the ~ 20/24 = 0.83 observed to gel at this
iteration without the use of the classifier. Using
the aforementioned values in Bayes’ rule gives
a sizable probability of 0.32 to gel given it is
predicted to not gel. As partial validation to the

suboptimal way to avoid gelling candidates.
To simultaneously address both shortcomings, the classifier was retrained with gelation data up to
iteration four and directly incorporated into the optimization objective itself for iteration five (full exploit of
the GOx campaign). Here, the probability of not gelling predicted by the RFC was used as a multiplicative
factor for values predicted by the GPR model. In this way, the exploit round for GOx was reframed from
selecting the candidates that had the highest predicted REA to instead candidates that had the highest
“expected REA”, valuing the REA of gelled polymers at 0% since we do not consider them as viable
materials for PPHs:

               𝐸[𝑅𝐸𝐴] = ∑ 𝜇𝑖 (𝑥) 𝑝𝑖 (𝑥) = 𝜇𝑖 (𝑥) ∗ (1 − 𝑝𝑖 (𝑥)) + 0 ∗ 𝑝(𝑥) = 𝜇𝑖 (𝑥) ∗ (1 − 𝑝𝑖 (𝑥))



                                                        17
Optimization with this objective function accounts for gelation behavior and allows for risks in selecting
candidates with high probability of gelling if there is a suitably high predicted REA. Accordingly,
candidates produced from this round of active learning had only 3/24 polymers gel and had the highest
mean REA of any iteration of the GOx campaign. This objective resembles that used by Gardner et al. in
performing BO with black-box constraints, which in this case are gelling regions of the chemical space.1
