Protein-macromolecule interactions pH dependence and machine learning25926 group discussion M1 Shunya SudoResearch Objectives My research goal is to discover polymers that boost heat resistance without compromising activity for three enzymes: horseradish peroxidase, glucose oxidase, and lipase. I focus on three monomer types—zwitterionic, cationic, and hydrophobic—and apply Bayesian optimization to efficiently find the best composition ratios with minimal experiments. We start with MPC as the zwitterionic monomer, MTAC as the cationic monomer, and BMA as the hydrophobic monomer. Once we determine the optimal MPC/MTAC/BMA ratio, we will explore other hydrophobic units—EHMA, LMA, and MPTSSi—to identify the most effective hydrophobic component.Feed Ratio (mol %)Composition Ratio (mol %)PolymerMPCBMAMTACMPCBMAMTACPMBTA-18041684.42.513.1PMBTA-28016478.615.95.5PMBTA-330145630.414.255.4PMBTA-430561432.733.234.1PMBTA-55522.522.550.322.422.4Summary of this report・Aggregation state of copolymer and enzyme when dissolved in EtOH・Enhancement of lipase thermal stability by copolymer PMBTA・Enhancement of GOx thermal stability by copolymer PMBTAMeasurement of particle size distribution (PMBTA)The polymer was dissolved in ethanol, and then the particle size distribution was measured.Figure 1. Particle size distribution of PMBTA with 1% EtOH (2025/8).Experimental MethodsThe copolymers PMBTA-1~5 were dissolved in EtOH to prepare a 50 mg/mL polymer stock solution.10 μL of (1) was added to 990 μL of water.780 μL of (2) was used for measurement.1.2 Particle size distribution Particle size distribution was measured for each of PMBTA-1-5.Table 1.

Zeta potential of PMBTA with 1% EtOH (2025/8).2.1 Zeta potentialMeasured simultaneously with the same solution as particle size distribution.Table 2.

The particle size distributions of lipase and GOx were measured.Experimental MethodsLip-1%EtOH-indirect (The enzyme does not come into contact with pure ethanol.)Weighed 1.0 mg of lipase (GOx) (and sequentially added water and EtOH to achieve an enzyme concentration of 0.5 mg/mL).Added 1980 μL of water (0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.0 for GOx).Added 20 μL of EtOH.Lip (GOx)-1%EtOH-direct (Enzymes come into contact with pure ethanol)Lipase (GOx) was dissolved in EtOH to prepare a 50 mg/mL solution.Add 10 μL of solution (1) to 990 μL of water (0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.0 for GOx).Lip-water, GOx-waterDissolve Lip (GOx) in water (0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.0 for GOx) to prepare a 0.5 mg/mL solution.3.2 Particle size distributionFigure 3. Particle size distribution of GOx.Figure 4. Particle size distribution of Lip.GOx did not affect the particle size distribution with or without 1% EtOH.Lip had larger particle sizes and less clean data, but was unaffected by EtOH.Measurement of zeta potential (Lip, GOx)Measured the zeta potential using the solution employed for particle size distribution.Figure 5. Zeta potential of GOx and Lip.The presence of 1% EtOH did not significantly alter the zeta potential.It is considered that the enzyme structure remains unchanged even upon contact with 1% EtOH.Enzyme activity with EtOH (Lip)The effect of 1% ethanol on the heat tolerance of Lip was investigated.Experimental MethodsDissolve Lip in buffer (water/0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.0 = 50/50) and prepare a 0.05 mg/mL solution.Aliquoted into 1 mL tubes and heated in a thermoshaker.

It was found that EtOH at approximately 1% does not inhibit Lip activity.REA (Retain Enzyme Activity) was calculated from the absolute activity at 0 minutes and the absolute activity at each heating time point.The REA when heated for n minutes isFigure 6.

To facilitate comparison when adding the polymer, a sample was selected that retains 20% residual activity after 40 minutes of heating in a neutral state.Experimental MethodsGOx was dissolved and prepared at three concentrations: 0.0016 mg/mL, 0.0008 mg/mL, and 0.0004 mg/mL in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.0.The solutions were aliquoted into 1 mL tubes and heated in a thermoshaker. (60°C: 0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 40 min, 60 min)Preparation of the substrate solutionHRP was dissolved at 1 mg/mL in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.0, to prepare the HRP solution.Glucose was dissolved at 1.8 mg/mL in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.0, to prepare the glucose solution.Prepare a 10 mL substrate solution by adding 50 μL of HRP solution, 5 mL of glucose solution, 50 μL of Amplex Red, and 4.95 mL of pH 7.0 PBS.Data was collected using a plate reader, and the slope obtained by fitting the initial velocity of the assay was defined as the enzyme activity (interval: 10 seconds, repeat: 60 times).An appropriate concentration was selected as the initial activity.ResultFigure 10.
